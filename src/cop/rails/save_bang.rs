/// Rails/SaveBang - flags ActiveRecord persist methods (save, update, destroy, create, etc.)
/// whose return value is not checked, suggesting bang variants instead.
///
/// ## Investigation findings (2026-03-08)
///
/// **Root cause of massive FN (24,736):** `visit_call_node` did not visit `BlockNode`
/// children of CallNodes. It only handled `block_argument_node` (e.g., `&block`) but
/// not actual block bodies (e.g., `items.each { |i| i.save }`). Since `visit_block_node`
/// was never invoked for blocks attached to calls, persist calls inside any block body
/// were invisible to the cop.
///
/// **Fix:** Added `block.as_block_node()` handling in `visit_call_node` to invoke
/// `visit_block_node` for block bodies attached to call nodes.
///
/// **FP cause (558):** `persisted?` follow-up checks were not recognized. When a create
/// method result was assigned to a variable and `persisted?` was called on that variable
/// in the next statement (e.g., `user = User.create; if user.persisted?`), the cop
/// incorrectly flagged the create call. Also, inline patterns like
/// `(user = User.create).persisted?` were not suppressed.
///
/// **Fix:** Added lookahead in statement visitors to detect `persisted?` checks on
/// assigned variables. Added suppression when `persisted?` is called directly on a
/// receiver containing a create assignment.
///
/// **Remaining gaps:** Large FN count likely has additional causes beyond block traversal,
/// such as unhandled control flow patterns or context-tracking gaps. The block fix
/// addresses the primary structural issue.
///
/// ## Investigation findings (2026-03-10)
///
/// **FP cause: receiver context suppression.** `visit_call_node` was pushing `Argument`
/// context for ALL receivers, including non-persisted? method chains. This meant
/// `object.save.to_s`, `object.save.inspect`, etc. were incorrectly suppressed
/// because `save` (as receiver of `to_s`) got Argument context. In RuboCop, only
/// `.persisted?` receivers are suppressed via `checked_immediately?`.
///
/// **Fix:** Only push Argument context for receivers when the call is `persisted?`.
/// For other methods, the receiver inherits parent context, allowing persist calls
/// to be flagged when chained with non-persisted? methods.
///
/// **FP cause: negation not treated as condition.** `!object.save` / `not object.save`
/// was not recognized as condition context. RuboCop's `single_negative?` check treats
/// unary `!`/`not` as part of `operator_or_single_negative?`, exempting modify methods.
///
/// **Fix:** Added special handling for `!` CallNodes (no arguments) to push Condition
/// context for the receiver.
///
/// **FP cause: yield/super arguments not recognized.** `yield object.save` and
/// `super(object.save)` were not treated as argument context because `visit_yield_node`
/// and `visit_super_node` were not overridden.
///
/// **Fix:** Added `visit_yield_node` and `visit_super_node` to push Argument context.
///
/// **FN cause: string interpolation treated as argument.** `"#{object.save}"` was
/// suppressed because `visit_embedded_statements_node` pushed Argument context.
/// RuboCop does NOT treat interpolation as "using" the return value.
///
/// **Fix:** Removed Argument context push from `visit_embedded_statements_node`.
///
/// ## Investigation findings (2026-03-18)
///
/// **FP cause: persisted? lookahead was limited to next statement only.** When a create
/// method result was assigned to a variable and `persisted?` was called several statements
/// later (not immediately), the cop incorrectly flagged the assignment. RuboCop uses
/// VariableForce to track ALL references to the assigned variable across the entire scope,
/// including calls inside nested conditionals, method calls, and other expressions.
///
/// Examples that were FPs:
/// - `user = User.create; logger.info; if user.persisted?` — intervening statement
/// - `@user = User.create; render json: @user, status: @user.persisted? ? :ok : :err` — non-adjacent
/// - `record = find_or_create_by(name:); log("id=#{record.id}"); raise unless record.persisted?`
///
/// **Fix:** Changed `should_suppress_create` to scan ALL subsequent statements (not just
/// the next one) using `subtree_checks_persisted`, a visitor-based recursive search.
/// Added `PersistedFinder` visitor struct that searches any subtree for `var.persisted?`.
///
/// **Scope:** The scan is bounded to the current `StatementsNode` body (same method/block
/// scope), matching RuboCop's per-scope VariableForce tracking. Cross-method references
/// are correctly not suppressed.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-19)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=1437, FN=4678 (82% match).
///
/// **FP root cause 1: Non-local variable create-in-assignment flagged.**
/// RuboCop's VariableForce only tracks local variables. Instance/class/global variable
/// create assignments (e.g., `@user = User.create(...)`) are skipped by
/// `return_value_assigned?` in `on_send` and never checked by VariableForce's
/// `check_assignment`. Nitrocop was flagging all create-in-assignment regardless.
/// **Fix:** Added `in_local_assignment` flag; only flag create-in-assignment for locals.
///
/// **FN root cause 1: Receiver chain context propagation.**
/// When a persist call is the receiver of a method chain (e.g., `log(object.save.to_s)`),
/// nitrocop was inheriting the outer Argument/Assignment context down to the persist call,
/// incorrectly exempting it. RuboCop evaluates each persist call independently — the
/// immediate parent being a chained method doesn't exempt it.
/// **Fix:** Push VoidStatement context when visiting non-persisted? receiver chains.
///
/// **FN root cause 2: Multi-statement body ImplicitReturn.**
/// RuboCop's `implicit_return?` only recognizes single-statement method/block bodies.
/// In a multi-statement body, the last statement's parent is a `begin` node (not def/block
/// directly), so `implicit_return?` returns false. Nitrocop was marking the last statement
/// as ImplicitReturn for ALL method/block bodies regardless of statement count.
/// **Fix:** Only grant ImplicitReturn when the body has exactly one statement (len == 1).
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-19, batch 2)
///
/// Oracle: FP=240, FN=183 (98.6% match rate on 31,933 offenses).
///
/// **FP root cause 1: Narrow literal check in expected_signature (100+ FP).**
/// Only checked StringNode/IntegerNode/SymbolNode. Missed InterpolatedStringNode,
/// InterpolatedSymbolNode, ArrayNode, TrueNode, FalseNode, etc. RuboCop's
/// `expected_signature?` uses `!node.first_argument.literal?` which covers all literals.
/// **Fix:** Added `is_literal_node()` helper covering all Prism literal types.
///
/// **FP root cause 2: Array/hash Collection context too permissive (56+ FP).**
/// Pushed Collection context for array/hash elements, exempting persist calls inside
/// arrays. RuboCop's `assignable_node` climbs through arrays/hashes — elements inherit
/// the enclosing context. `[save]` in void context IS flagged.
/// **Fix:** Made arrays/hashes transparent (inherit parent context).
///
/// **FP root cause 3: Setter receiver not recognized as assignment (22 FP).**
/// `create.multipart = true` — RuboCop's `return_value_assigned?` treats setter calls
/// (`method=`) as assignments via `SendNode#assignment?` (alias for `setter_method?`).
/// **Fix:** Detect setter methods in `visit_call_node` and push Assignment context.
///
/// **FP root cause 4: Missing assignment node visitors (10+ FP).**
/// Missing visitors for operator-write (`+=`), or-write (`||=`), and-write (`&&=`),
/// constant or-write, index or-write, call or-write, etc. Persist calls in these
/// contexts got void context instead of assignment.
/// **Fix:** Added visitors for all Prism write/operator-write node types.
///
/// **FP root cause 5: Parenthesized conditions lost context (6 FP).**
/// `if(@result.save)` — ParenthesesNode body is a StatementsNode, and our
/// `visit_statements_node` pushed VoidStatement, overriding the Condition context.
/// **Fix:** `visit_parentheses_node` unwraps StatementsNode, visiting children directly.
///
/// **FP root cause 6: ||= and &&= flagging create (4+ FP).**
/// RuboCop's VariableForce `check_assignment` returns early for or_asgn/and_asgn
/// because `right_assignment_node` gets the lvasgn target, not the RHS.
/// **Fix:** Don't set `in_local_assignment` for ||= and &&= write nodes.
///
/// **FP root cause 7: Block argument not counted in expected_signature (5+ FP).**
/// `create(hash, &block)` has 2 args in RuboCop (block_pass counts), but Prism
/// separates block from arguments. Our count was 1.
/// **Fix:** Count BlockArgumentNode in total argument count.
///
/// **FN root cause 1: Array/hash Collection context suppressed offenses (30+ FN).**
/// Same fix as FP root cause 2 — making arrays/hashes transparent both fixes FPs
/// (arrays in void context now flag) and FNs (arrays in assignment context now exempt).
///
/// **FN root cause 2: Singleton method implicit return (14+ FN).**
/// `def self.method; create(name: 'x'); end` — RuboCop's `implicit_return?` only
/// matches `def`, not `defs`. Nitrocop gave ImplicitReturn for all DefNode.
/// **Fix:** Only grant ImplicitReturn when DefNode has no receiver (instance method).
///
/// **Remaining (6 FP, 34 FN):** Edge cases including block_node unwrapping in
/// `assignable_node` (RuboCop unwraps `create { }` to the block_node before checking
/// parent context), and complex control flow patterns. These represent <0.13% of total
/// offenses and are documented for future investigation.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-19, batch 3)
///
/// Oracle: FP=18, FN=37 (99.8% match rate on 32,661 offenses).
///
/// **FP root cause: create inside array/hash in local variable assignment (18 FP).**
/// `x = [Model.create(...), Model.create(...)]` — RuboCop's VariableForce
/// `check_assignment` checks `if rhs_node.send_type?` on the RHS. ArrayNode/HashNode
/// doesn't match, so create calls inside arrays in local assignments are never flagged.
/// Nitrocop was propagating `in_local_assignment` through transparent array/hash nodes.
/// **Fix:** Save and reset `in_local_assignment` to false in `visit_array_node`,
/// `visit_hash_node`, `visit_keyword_hash_node`.
///
/// **FN root cause: block-wrapped create in argument context (7 FN).**
/// `Subscription.create { cleanup }` as an array element inside a method argument.
/// In RuboCop's Parser gem AST, `create { }` becomes `Block(Send, Args, Body)`.
/// `argument?` on the Send walks: Send→Block(parent)→array, and Block.parent is not
/// `send_type?`, so `argument?` returns false — RuboCop flags it. In Prism, the block
/// is part of the CallNode, so the CallNode inherits Argument context from the enclosing
/// expression.
/// **Fix:** In `process_persist_call`, when context is Argument and the call has a
/// block body (BlockNode, not BlockArgumentNode), treat as VoidStatement.
///
/// **Remaining (~30 FN):** Various patterns in discourse, galetahub, natalie-lang etc.
/// including Hash#update on hash literal in splat args (4 FN, hard to fix without
/// parent tracking) and unknown patterns across ~16 repos.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-19, batch 4)
///
/// Targeted fix for remaining ~24 FN from batch 3. Four root causes:
///
/// **FN root cause 1: Create in compound boolean (16 FN).**
/// RuboCop checks `compound_boolean?` for create methods — if the create call is inside
/// `||`/`&&`/`or`/`and`, it's ALWAYS flagged as conditional regardless of enclosing
/// assignment/argument context. Only `implicit_return?` and `explicit_return?` walk
/// through or_type? parents to exempt.
/// **Fix:** Added `in_compound_boolean` flag set inside `visit_or_node`/`visit_and_node`.
///
/// **FN root cause 2: Rescue modifier breaks context chains (5 FN).**
/// `@post.destroy rescue nil` — RuboCop's `implicit_return?` doesn't walk through
/// rescue_modifier, and `assignable_node` stops at rescue_mod.
/// **Fix:** Added `visit_rescue_modifier_node` pushing VoidStatement for the expression.
///
/// **FN root cause 3: Yield/super arguments not argument context (2+ FN).**
/// RuboCop's `argument?` only checks `parent.send_type?`. Yield/super are not send_type?.
/// **Fix:** Changed `visit_yield_node`/`visit_super_node` to push VoidStatement.
///
/// **FN root cause 4: Splat breaks argument context (1 FN).**
/// `execute *builder.create` — `assignable_node` stops at splat, `argument?` returns false.
/// **Fix:** Added `visit_splat_node` pushing VoidStatement for the expression.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-19, batch 5)
///
/// Location-level verification: FP=18→6, FN=37→1 (48 of 55 known mismatches fixed).
///
/// **FN root cause 5: Or/And node inherited Assignment context (3 FN).**
/// `@dir = get || create(...)` — RuboCop's `return_value_assigned?` uses `assignable_node`
/// which only walks through hash/array parents, NOT through or/and nodes. So create inside
/// `||` inside an assignment is NOT considered assigned — compound_boolean takes priority.
/// **Fix:** `visit_or_node` no longer inherits Assignment context from parent. When the or
/// is inside an assignment, children get Condition context (compound_boolean path).
///
/// **FN root cause 6: ImplicitReturn leaked through if/else branches (1 FN).**
/// `def m; if cond; self.x = find || create; end; end` — the if node is the single
/// statement in the method body (ImplicitReturn), but RuboCop's `implicit_return?` does NOT
/// walk through if/case/begin nodes — it only walks through or_type? parents.
/// **Fix:** `visit_if_node` and `visit_unless_node` push VoidStatement for body/else clauses
/// to prevent ImplicitReturn from the outer scope leaking into branches.
///
/// **FN root cause 7: Or node ImplicitReturn applied to both children (1 FN).**
/// `items.map { |v| Gem::Version.create(v) or raise }` — create is the LEFT child of `or`
/// in a single-statement block body. RuboCop's `implicit_return?` uses `sibling_index` +
/// `find_method_with_sibling_index` where walking through an or_type? increments the index.
/// The formula `method.children.size == node.sibling_index + sibling_index` only holds for
/// the RIGHT child (index 1), not the LEFT child (index 0) of the or expression.
/// **Fix:** `visit_or_node` only grants ImplicitReturn to the right child; left child gets
/// Condition context.
///
/// **FN root cause 8: csend `&.persisted?` incorrectly suppressed create (1 FN).**
/// `s = DomainSetup.create(...); s if s&.persisted?` — RuboCop's `call_to_persisted?`
/// checks `node.send_type?` which excludes csend (safe navigation). So `s&.persisted?`
/// does NOT count as a persisted? check. Our PersistedFinder and checked_immediately path
/// were matching both send and csend.
/// **Fix:** Added csend detection (call_operator length == 2) to exclude `&.persisted?`.
///
/// **FP root cause: create in `&&` with direct assignment (discourse topic.rb).**
/// `if (new_post = creator.create) && new_post.present?` — create is directly assigned
/// inside a `&&` expression. RuboCop's `return_value_assigned?` sees the assignment parent
/// and returns true (priority over compound_boolean). Our compound_boolean check was
/// overriding the Assignment context.
/// **Fix:** When `in_compound_boolean` is true but current context is Assignment (meaning
/// the create was directly assigned inside the boolean), let the assignment path handle it.
///
/// **Remaining (6 FP, 1 FN):**
/// - 6 FP: Require VariableForce-level tracking (non-adjacent persisted? checks in
///   complex control flow, multi-write assignments). Examples: discourse topic.rb:1112
///   (`(x=create)&&x.present?` with `x.persisted?` in if-body), discourse
///   export_csv_file.rb:85 (create in local var, value used non-adjacent), redmine
///   project.rb (save in if-body), taps operation.rb (create-with-block in multi-write).
///   Some may also be oracle artifacts (config differences or stale data).
/// - 1 FN: neo4j association_proxy_spec.rb:225 (`Lesson.create` inside `[x, create]`
///   inside `+=` operator — may be an oracle artifact since `+=` RHS array isn't tracked
///   by VariableForce's `right_assignment_node`).
