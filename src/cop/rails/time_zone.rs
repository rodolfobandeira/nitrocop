/// Rails/TimeZone — checks for Time methods without zone.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-10)
///
/// **FP root cause (qualified constant paths):** `util::constant_name()` extracted
/// just the last segment of a ConstantPathNode, so `Some::Time.now` matched as
/// `Time` and was falsely flagged. Fix: inline the constant check to verify the
/// receiver is either a bare `Time` (ConstantReadNode) or root-qualified `::Time`
/// (ConstantPathNode with parent=None/cbase). Matches RuboCop's `(const {nil? cbase} :Time)`.
///
/// **FN root cause (extra SAFE_METHODS):** `getutc`, `rfc2822`, `rfc822`, `to_r`
/// were in the safe methods list but are NOT in RuboCop's ACCEPTED_METHODS, causing
/// `Time.now.getutc` etc. to be incorrectly exempted. Removed these methods.
///
/// **Remaining gaps:**
/// - Strict mode does not check GOOD_METHODS chain (e.g., `Time.now.zone` is
///   flagged in strict mode but shouldn't be). Requires AST parent walking.
/// - Byte-level chain scanner vs RuboCop's AST parent walking: the scanner works
///   correctly for most cases because `call.location().end_offset()` ends at the
///   closing paren of arguments, so `foo(Time.now).utc` correctly sees `)` (not
///   `.utc`) after `Time.now`. Edge cases with complex nesting may still diverge.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-15): FP=7, FN=59
///
/// Two fixes:
///
/// **1. Nested `Time.now`/`Time.local` inside outer call with safe chain (FP fix, 7 FPs):**
/// `Time.to_mongo(Time.local(...)).zone` — the inner `Time.local(...)` was flagged because
/// `enclosing_call_is_safe` only checked whether the immediate enclosing method was safe
/// (e.g., `to_mongo` — not safe) but didn't scan the chain AFTER the outer call's closing
/// `)`. Also, it only checked the first argument position (`(`), not later arguments
/// (`Time.parse(x, Time.now).iso8601`). Fix: replaced direct `(` check with
/// `find_enclosing_open_paren()` that scans backward through balanced parens to find the
/// containing `(` regardless of argument position. Added `find_matching_close_paren()` to
/// locate the outer call's closing `)`, then `chain_contains_tz_safe_method()` checks the
/// chain continuing after it.
///
/// **2. `String#to_time` detection in both modes (FN fix):**
/// RuboCop's `on_send` fires on `.to_time` unconditionally (no mode check), but ONLY when
/// the receiver is a string literal (`node.receiver&.str_type?`). Previously nitrocop
/// only flagged in strict mode AND flagged variable receivers too. Fixed to:
/// - Fire in both flexible and strict mode (matching RuboCop's unconditional `on_send`)
/// - Only flag when receiver is a string literal node (not variables)
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-15): FP=17, FN=82
///
/// Two fixes:
///
/// **1. `.localtime` without args now treated as unsafe (FN fix, ~82 FNs):**
/// RuboCop treats `.localtime` without arguments as an offense (MSG_LOCALTIME) and
/// `.localtime(offset)` as accepted. Previously all `.localtime` was in SAFE_METHODS.
/// Fix: removed `localtime` from `chain_contains_tz_safe_method` SAFE_METHODS and added
/// special handling that only treats it as safe when followed by `(` with arguments.
///
/// **2. `Time.now` inside `Time.at(..., in:)` — REVERTED (was FP fix, ~10 FPs):**
/// Previously added `IN_KEYWORD_METHODS` check in `enclosing_call_is_safe_recursive` to
/// suppress inner `Time.now` when the outer call had `in:` keyword. This was incorrect:
/// RuboCop's `in:` keyword only makes the OUTER `Time.at` call safe (handled at line 250
/// via `has_in_keyword_arg`), but inner `Time.now` arguments should still be flagged.
/// The original "FP" was actually correct behavior — removed the IN_KEYWORD_METHODS check
/// and `enclosing_parens_have_in_keyword` function. Fixes 26 FN in corpus.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-14): FP=25
///
/// Two root causes addressed:
///
/// **1. Interpolated string timezone specifier (ManageIQ/feedjira, ~4 FPs):**
/// `Time.parse("#{ts} UTC", ...)` — the first argument is a dstr (interpolated string)
/// ending with a timezone indicator. RuboCop's `attach_timezone_specifier?` checks
/// `date.respond_to?(:value)`. In RuboCop's AST, dstr nodes for `"#{expr} UTC"` have
/// a last child of `str(" UTC")`. The check implicitly covers this via the last part.
/// Fix: added explicit check of the last string literal part of InterpolatedStringNode.
///
/// **2. Time.now inside Time.utc(...) arguments (ice_cube, ~4 FPs):**
/// `Time.utc(Time.now.year - 1, ...)` — RuboCop's parent-chain walking traverses
/// through the argument position into the enclosing call, making chain = [now, year, -, utc].
/// `utc` is in ACCEPTED_METHODS → not_danger_chain? returns true → no offense.
/// Nitrocop's forward byte scanner stops at the `)` following `Time.now.year-1` and
/// doesn't see the outer `Time.utc(...)` call.
/// Fix: added `enclosing_call_is_safe()` backward scan: if Time.now is directly preceded
/// by `safe_method(`, suppress the offense.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-18): FP=1, FN=361
///
/// **FN root cause (`String#to_time` in flexible mode):**
/// RuboCop's `on_send` fires on `.to_time` in BOTH strict and flexible mode, but only
/// when the receiver is a string literal (`node.receiver&.str_type?`). Nitrocop was only
/// firing in strict mode AND was incorrectly flagging variable receivers (e.g.,
/// `date_str.to_time`). Fixed by: (1) removing the strict-mode gate so `to_time` fires
/// in both modes, (2) checking that the receiver is a string literal node before flagging.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-18): FP=1, FN=334
///
/// **FN root cause (grouping parens treated as method-call parens):**
/// `enclosing_call_is_safe()` found the enclosing `(` via `find_enclosing_open_paren()`,
/// then extracted the "method name" before it. For grouping parens like
/// `(Time.now - 1.day).to_i`, the `(` had no method name — it picked up an identifier
/// from a completely different line/statement. Even when no identifier was found (e.g.,
/// after `=` or `||`), it fell through to check the chain after the closing `)`, where
/// `.to_i` was in SAFE_METHODS and incorrectly suppressed the offense.
///
/// Fix: three guards before treating the enclosing `(` as method-call parens:
/// 1. `method_start > end_of_method` — no identifier at all (preceded by operator/punct)
/// 2. Newline between method name and `(` — identifier is from a different statement
/// 3. Method name is a Ruby keyword (`return`, `if`, etc.) — keywords use grouping parens
///
/// Fixes ~300+ of the 334 FN (grouping paren patterns in corpus).
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-18): FP=1, FN=43
///
/// **FN root cause (method name truncation with `?`/`!` suffixes):**
/// `chain_contains_tz_safe_method()` read method names using only alphanumeric + underscore,
/// truncating `utc?` to `utc` which matched SAFE_METHODS and suppressed the offense.
/// Fix: include `?` and `!` in the method name character set so `utc?` is read as `utc?`
/// and does NOT match `utc` in SAFE_METHODS. Fixes 43 FN across jruby, natalie-lang,
/// sidekiq and other corpus repos.
///
/// **FP root cause (deeply nested parens):**
/// `Time.parse(helper_method(Time.now)).utc` — the inner `Time.now` is nested two levels
/// deep. `enclosing_call_is_safe()` only checked the immediate enclosing `(` (from
/// `helper_method`), which was not safe, and the chain after `helper_method(...)` was `)`
/// (not `.utc`). Fix: made `enclosing_call_is_safe()` recursive (up to 3 levels) so it
/// checks the next enclosing `(` (from `Time.parse`), whose chain after `)` is `.utc`.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-19): FN=16
///
/// **1. Grouping parens with space (12 FN — FIXED):** `schedule (Time.now - 60).to_f` —
/// backward scan found `schedule` before `(`, but the space between `schedule` and `(`
/// means the `(` is a subexpression grouping paren. The `.to_f` after `)` chains on the
/// grouped expression, not the `schedule` call. Fix: detect space/tab in the gap between
/// method name and `(`; when present (`is_spaced_paren`), skip the chain-after-closing-paren
/// check in `enclosing_call_is_safe_recursive`.
///
/// **2. Safe navigation `&.` chain break (2+ FN — REVERTED):** `Time.at(val)&.utc` — in
/// RuboCop, `csend` (safe navigation) is not `send_type?`, so `extract_method_chain` stops
/// at `&.utc`. Attempted fix: removed `&.` handling from `chain_contains_tz_safe_method`.
/// REVERTED because corpus rerun showed FP=405: many legitimate `Time.at(x)&.utc` patterns
/// in the corpus ARE accepted by RuboCop (possibly via a different code path or because
/// `csend` handling changed in newer parser versions). Restoring `&.` handling eliminates
/// the 405 FPs while leaving ~2-4 FN from the `&.` pattern. The FN are acceptable since
/// `&.utc` genuinely provides timezone safety.
///
/// Remaining FN after spaced-paren fix: ~4-6 (2+ from `&.` pattern, plus possible
/// other patterns in rack-contrib, rack-cache, TracksApp, flippercloud, hackclub).
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-19): FN=7 (corpus oracle)
///
/// Investigated all 7 FN across 5 repos. Two fixes applied:
///
/// **1. Grouping paren recursion (2 FN in rack-cache — FIXED):**
/// `Time.httpdate((Time.now - (60**2)).httpdate)` — the inner `(Time.now - ...)`
/// is a grouping paren. Previously, `enclosing_call_is_safe_recursive` recursed
/// past it and found the outer `Time.httpdate(` whose method `httpdate` was in
/// SAFE_METHODS, incorrectly suppressing the offense. In RuboCop, grouping parens
/// create a `begin` AST node which stops `extract_method_chain`'s parent walk.
/// Fix: when `is_grouping_paren` is true, return false immediately instead of
/// recursing. This matches RuboCop's chain-breaking `begin` node semantics.
///
/// **2. String interpolation boundary (1 FN in flippercloud — FIXED):**
/// `"tolerance zone (#{Time.at(ts)})"` — `find_enclosing_open_paren` scanned
/// backward through the `#{` interpolation boundary and found the literal `(`
/// from the string text `zone (`. The word `zone` before it matched SAFE_METHODS,
/// incorrectly suppressing the offense. Fix: stop backward scan at `#{` boundaries
/// (return None when `bytes[i] == b'{'` and `bytes[i-1] == b'#'`).
///
/// **Previous 4 FN now FIXED (2026-03-19):**
///
/// **1. `&.` breaks chain (feedbin, 2 FN):** RuboCop's `extract_method_chain` uses
/// `node.send_type?` which excludes `csend` (safe navigation). So `Time.at(x)&.utc`
/// does NOT see `utc` in the chain → offense. Previous attempt was reverted due to
/// 405 FP, but the current corpus oracle baseline reflects the correct behavior.
/// Fix: stop `chain_contains_tz_safe_method` at `&.` instead of following it.
///
/// **2. `method_from_time_class?` gate (hackclub, 1 FN + 3 fixture corrections):**
/// `Duration.build(Time.now).seconds.to_i` — `.to_i` is on Duration, not Time.
/// RuboCop's `method_from_time_class?` returns false for non-Time receivers, so
/// `.to_i` isn't added to the chain. Fix: added `receiver_traces_to_time()` helper
/// and gated both the direct method name check AND chain-after-paren check in
/// `enclosing_call_is_safe_recursive`. Also corrected `foo(Time.now).in_time_zone`,
/// `bar(Time.local(...)).to_i`, and `wrap(Time.now).zone` from no_offense to
/// offense — these have non-Time receivers, so the safe chain doesn't apply.
///
/// **3. Non-dangerous Time.XXX in dangerous enclosing Time call (TracksApp, 1 FN):**
/// `Time.zone.local(year, month, Time.days_in_month(month))` — RuboCop's chain
/// walk goes up from inner `Time` through `days_in_month` to enclosing `local`,
/// where `method_from_time_class?` confirms the receiver traces to Time. Chain =
/// `[:days_in_month, :local]`, `:local` is dangerous, no good method → offense.
/// Fix: added `in_dangerous_time_context()` check for non-dangerous Time methods
/// that detects enclosing dangerous Time calls without safe chains.
