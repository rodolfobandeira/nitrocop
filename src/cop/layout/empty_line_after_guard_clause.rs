/// Enforces empty line after guard clause.
///
/// ## Corpus conformance investigation (2026-03-11, updated 2026-03-15)
///
/// **Root causes of FN (nitrocop misses offenses RuboCop catches):**
/// - `and`/`or` guard clauses: Fixed by recursing into the `right` child
///   of and/or nodes, matching RuboCop's `operator_keyword?` → `rhs` handling.
/// - Heredoc guard clauses: `raise "msg", <<-MSG unless cond` has the heredoc
///   body after the if node's location. Fixed by walking the guard's AST to find
///   heredoc arguments and using the heredoc end marker line as the effective end.
/// - Ternary guard clauses: `a ? raise(e) : b` is an IfNode with no if_keyword.
///   Fixed by detecting ternary if nodes where either branch is a guard statement.
///
/// **Root causes of FP (nitrocop flags things RuboCop doesn't):**
/// - Comment-then-blank pattern: `guard; # comment; blank; code` — fixed by
///   matching RuboCop's behavior: check the immediate next line for blank/directive
///   instead of skipping all comments to find the first code line.
/// - Heredoc interference: Fixed via heredoc end line detection.
///
/// - Whitespace-only blank lines: `is_blank_line` only matched truly empty lines,
///   but many files have trailing spaces/tabs on "blank" lines. Switched all blank
///   line checks to `is_blank_or_whitespace_line` to match RuboCop's `blank?`.
///
/// **FP fix (2026-03-17): Multi-line guard statements and continuation lines**
/// - Multi-line guard STATEMENTS (fail/raise/return call spanning lines via `\`,
///   multi-line strings, comma-separated args, or braces) are not guard clauses
///   per RuboCop's `match_guard_clause?` which requires `single_line?`. Added
///   the same check for modifier form (previously only block form was checked).
///   Exception: heredoc arguments make the statement multi-line in Prism but
///   RuboCop still treats them as valid guards.
/// - Consecutive guards with line continuations: `raise "msg" \\\n unless cond`
///   followed by `raise "msg" \\\n if cond` — the NEXT guard's `if`/`unless`
///   is on a continuation line. Extended `is_guard_line` → `is_guard_line_with_continuations`
///   to follow backslash/operator/comma continuations and multi-line expressions
///   to find the modifier keyword.
/// - Guard → comment → blank → guard pattern: RuboCop uses AST-level sibling
///   analysis which ignores comments/blanks. Extended the else branch in step 3
///   to also check for guard clauses after blank lines.
///
/// **FP fix (2026-03-18): Multi-line if/unless conditions in guard blocks**
/// - `is_multiline_guard_block` now tracks parenthesis/bracket depth and
///   continuation operators (`||`, `&&`, `==`, `===`, `\`, `,`, etc.) across
///   the `if`/`unless` condition to correctly skip condition continuation lines
///   before checking the body for a guard statement. Previously, multi-line
///   conditions like `if cond_a &&\n  cond_b\n  return\nend` would mistake the
///   second condition line for the body and fail to recognize the block as a
///   guard clause. This fixed FPs where a modifier guard was followed by a
///   multi-line block-form guard (the next sibling IS a guard, so no offense).
///
/// **FP/FN fix (2026-03-19): Ternary guard line detection was too broad**
/// - `is_ternary_guard_line` matched any line containing `?` and a guard keyword,
///   causing false negatives on lines like `return lines.include?("text")` where
///   `?` is part of the method name, not a ternary operator. Fixed by requiring
///   the `?` to be preceded by a space/`)` (expression boundary) AND followed by
///   space, plus a `:` separator — matching actual ternary `cond ? expr : expr`
///   syntax. This was the root cause of ~170 FNs across the corpus.
///
/// **FP fix (2026-03-19): String/regex-aware bracket counting and keyword matching**
/// - `is_multiline_guard_block` naively counted `[`, `{`, `(` inside string
///   literals and regex patterns, causing incorrect paren depth and wrong
///   condition continuation detection. Added `count_bracket_depth_change()` which
///   skips characters inside single/double-quoted strings and regex literals.
/// - `is_bare_guard_in_block` matched `if`/`unless` keywords inside string
///   literals (e.g., `raise "columns if you join"`), incorrectly treating bare
///   guard statements as modifier-form. Added `contains_word_outside_strings()`
///   to match keywords only outside string literals.
/// - `ends_with_continuation` had an overly strict word boundary check for
///   ` and`/` or` at end of line that rejected `to_sym or` because the `m`
///   before the space was an ident char. Removed the extra check since the
///   leading space in the pattern already ensures word separation.
///
/// **Remaining gaps:** Some edge cases with heredocs inside conditions
/// (e.g., `return true if <<~TEXT.length > bar`) may still differ.
///
/// ## Corpus conformance investigation (2026-03-20)
///
/// A remaining FN pattern came from lines like:
/// `return 'Object' if duck_type?` followed by
/// `return condition ? a : b`.
///
/// The previous `is_ternary_guard_line` helper worked on raw text and treated
/// any next line containing a ternary with a guard keyword somewhere on the
/// line as if the next sibling were a ternary guard clause. RuboCop's AST-level
/// check only suppresses offenses when the next sibling itself is an `if`/`unless`
/// node (including ternary `IfNode`), not when a bare `return` statement happens
/// to contain a ternary expression in its value. Fix: reject ternary-guard
/// suppression when the line itself starts with a guard keyword.
///
/// A remaining FP pattern came from consecutive guard blocks where the next
/// `if` condition continues onto the next line after a plain comparison
/// operator, e.g. `if (size || other) >` and the threshold on the next line.
/// `is_multiline_guard_block` uses `ends_with_continuation()` to keep scanning
/// condition lines, but that helper recognized `>=`/`<=` and not bare `>`/`<`.
/// Fix: treat trailing `<` and `>` as continuation operators while scanning
/// multi-line `if`/`unless` conditions.
///
/// Another remaining FP came from `next unless ...` followed by an
/// `unless..raise..end` guard block where the raise string contained bracket
/// characters like `[` or `{`. `is_bare_guard_in_block` used naive byte-level
/// bracket counting to reject multi-line guard statements, so brackets inside
/// string literals made the raise look like an unterminated expression and the
/// sibling guard block was missed. Fix: reuse `count_bracket_depth_change()`
/// there as well so bracket counting ignores string and regex content.
///
/// A remaining FN pattern came from normal expression lines that happened to
/// contain an embedded `return ... if ...` inside a block, e.g.
/// `items.each { |x| return true if predicate(x) }`. The old
/// `contains_modifier_guard()` helper matched any line containing a guard
/// keyword plus `if`/`unless`, even when both were nested inside a block body.
/// RuboCop only suppresses offenses when the next sibling itself is a guard
/// clause, not when the line merely contains an embedded guard expression.
/// Fix: require the guard keyword and modifier keyword to appear at top level
/// on the line (outside strings and bracketed subexpressions).
///
/// Another remaining FN pattern came from `if`/`unless` blocks whose first body
/// line only contained an operator guard nested inside braces, e.g.
/// `items.each { |x| predicate(x) and return x }`. `is_bare_guard_in_block`
/// treated any line containing `and`/`or`/`&&`/`||` plus a guard keyword as a
/// guard block body, even when both tokens were nested inside the block literal.
/// RuboCop only treats the first branch statement itself as a guard clause.
/// Fix: require operator guards inside block bodies to appear at top level too.
///
/// Another remaining FN cluster came from CRLF files. For modifier guards,
/// the cop checks whether there is more code after the `if`/`unless` node on
/// the same physical line and skips embedded expressions like
/// `arr.each { return x if cond }`. In CRLF files, that raw suffix slice could
/// begin with `\r`, and the old code treated `\r` as non-whitespace "code",
/// causing real guard clauses to be skipped. Fix: treat `\r`/`\n` as ignorable
/// whitespace in the same-line suffix check.
///
/// Another remaining FN family came from block-form `if` nodes with `elsif`
/// or `else` branches. The old Prism port rejected any `if` with
/// `subsequent().is_some()`, but RuboCop's `contains_guard_clause?` only asks
/// whether the node's `if_branch` is a guard clause. That means a multi-branch
/// `if` whose first branch is a guard still counts and should require a blank
/// line before the following statement. Fix: keep handling ternaries
/// separately, but do not reject ordinary `if` nodes just because they have
/// `elsif`/`else` branches.
///
/// **Reverted experiment (2026-03-20): UTF-8 same-line slicing and raw-text
/// guard-keyword boundary tightening**
/// - Attempted fix: commit `b6471854` (reverted in `74be9231`) fixed real FN
///   patterns where modifier guards contained UTF-8 bytes (`"✓"`, `"✅"`) and
///   where the next sibling line merely contained guard-like method names such
///   as `::Kernel.raise`, `fail!`, or `next!`.
/// - Acceptance gate before the experiment:
///   `check-cop.py --verbose --rerun` reported `expected=21,085 actual=21,124
///   excess=39 missing=0`, and `verify-cop-locations.py` was at `FN 16 remain`.
/// - Acceptance gate after the experiment:
///   `check-cop.py --verbose --rerun` reported `expected=21,085 actual=21,134
///   excess=49 missing=0`, while `verify-cop-locations.py` improved to
///   `FN 10 remain`.
/// - Effect: the change fixed 6 known oracle FN locations, but introduced 10
///   additional aggregate excess offenses elsewhere in the corpus.
/// - Root cause of regression: the raw-text sibling classification became
///   broader/narrower in ways that improved known examples but changed
///   guard-line suppression behavior on previously-unseen repo patterns.
/// - A correct future fix needs repo-level identification of those new excess
///   offenses first; do not reland the reverted boundary-tightening approach
///   without isolating the regressions.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-23)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=1, FN=28.

/// was treated as a guard clause. RuboCop's `guard_clause_node` returns nil
/// for `if...else...end` without elsif (regular if/else is never a guard).
/// Fix: skip block-form if nodes that have a direct else clause (not elsif).
