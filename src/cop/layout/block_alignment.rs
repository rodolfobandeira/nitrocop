/// Checks whether the end keywords / closing braces are aligned properly for

///
/// ## Corpus investigation findings (2026-03-11)
///
/// Root causes of 1,187 FP:
/// 1. **Trailing-dot method chains** — `find_chain_expression_start` only checked
///    for lines starting with `.` (leading dot) but NOT for lines ending with `.`
///    (trailing dot style). This caused the chain root to not be found, computing
///    wrong `expression_start_indent` and flagging correctly-aligned `end`.
/// 2. **Tab indentation** — `line_indent` only counted spaces, returning 0 for
///    tab-indented lines. But `offset_to_line_col` counts tabs as 1 character,
///    causing a mismatch between computed indent and actual `end` column.
/// 3. **Missing `begins_its_line?` check** — RuboCop skips alignment checks when
///    `end`/`}` is not the first non-whitespace on its line (e.g., `end.select`).
///    nitrocop checked all `end` keywords regardless.
///
/// Root causes of 334 FN:
/// 1. **Brace blocks not checked** — RuboCop checks both `do..end` and `{..}`
///    blocks, but nitrocop only checked `do..end`. Many FNs were misaligned `}`.
///
/// Fixes applied:
/// - `line_indent` now counts both spaces and tabs
/// - `find_chain_expression_start` now handles trailing-dot chains (lines ending with `.`)
/// - Added `begins_its_line` check to skip non-line-beginning closers
/// - Added brace block (`{..}`) checking with same alignment rules
/// - Fixed `start_of_block` style to use do-line indent (not `do` column) per RuboCop spec
///
/// ## Corpus investigation findings (2026-03-14)
///
/// Root causes of remaining 411 FP:
/// 1. **String concatenation `+` continuation** — Lines ending with `+` (common in
///    RSpec multiline descriptions like `it "foo " + "bar" do`) were not recognized
///    as expression continuations. `find_chain_expression_start` stopped too early,
///    computing wrong `expression_start_indent` and flagging correctly-aligned `end`.
///    Fixed by adding `+` to the continuation character set.
///
/// Root causes of remaining 103 FN:
/// 1. **Assignment RHS alignment accepted** — `find_call_expression_col` walked
///    backward from `do`/`{` to find the call expression start, but stopped at the
///    RHS of assignments (e.g., `answer = prompt.select do`). This made `call_expr_col`
///    point to `prompt` instead of `answer`, causing nitrocop to accept `end` aligned
///    with the RHS when RuboCop requires alignment with the LHS variable.
///    Fixed by adding `skip_assignment_backward` to walk through `=`/`+=`/`||=`/etc.
///    to find the LHS variable.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation findings (2026-03-18)
///
/// Root causes of remaining 176 FP:
/// 1. **Multiline string literals** — The line-based heuristic `find_chain_expression_start`
///    could not detect string literals spanning multiple lines without explicit continuation
///    markers (e.g., `it "long desc\n    continued" do`). This caused the expression start
///    to be computed from the wrong line.
/// 2. **Comment lines between continuations** — Comment lines interleaved in multi-line
///    method calls (e.g., RSpec `it` with keyword args after comments) broke the backward
///    line walk.
///
/// Root causes of remaining 55 FN:
/// 1. **Over-eager backward walk** — `find_chain_expression_start` walked through unclosed
///    brackets into outer expressions (e.g., from `lambda{|env|` through `show_status(` into
///    `req = ...`), computing an expression indent that matched the misaligned closer.
///
/// Fix: Replaced `BLOCK_NODE` with `CALL_NODE` dispatch. The CallNode's `location()` in
/// Prism spans the entire expression including receiver chains, giving the exact expression
/// start without heuristic line-based backward walking. This eliminates multiline string,
/// comment interleaving, and bracket-balance issues in one structural change.
/// Replaced `find_chain_expression_start` with `find_operator_continuation_start` which
/// only walks through `||`, `&&`, `<<`, `+` operators (not brackets/commas/backslashes),
/// preventing over-eager backward walking that caused false negatives.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation findings (2026-03-18, round 2)
///
/// Root causes of remaining 16 FP:
/// 1. **Chained blocks in assignment context** — `response = stub_comms do ... end.check_request do`
///    where `end` at col N aligns with the method call (`stub_comms`) but the assignment LHS
///    (`response`) is at a different column. The old code skipped `call_start_col` when
///    `assignment_col.is_some()`, preventing recognition of valid intermediate alignment.
///    Fixed by accepting `call_start_col` when the closer is chained (`.method` or `&.method`
///    follows `end`/`}`).
/// 2. **`&&`/`||` on same line as `do`/`{`** — `a && b.each do ... end` where `end` aligns
///    with the LHS of the `&&` expression. Added `find_same_line_operator_lhs` to detect
///    binary operators before the CallNode on the same line.
///
/// Root causes of remaining 34 FN:
/// 1. **Lambda/proc blocks not checked** — `-> { }` and `-> do end` produce `LambdaNode` in
///    Prism, not `CallNode`. The cop only dispatched on `CALL_NODE`. Added `LAMBDA_NODE`
///    dispatch with `check_lambda_alignment` method.
/// 2. **`do_col` incorrectly accepted as alignment target** — The column of the `do`/`{`
///    keyword itself was accepted in "either" mode, but RuboCop only accepts the indent
///    of the do-line (`indentation_of_do_line`) and the expression start column. Removing
///    `do_col` from accepted targets fixes FNs like `Hash.new do ... end` where `end` at
///    the `do` column was incorrectly accepted.
/// 3. **Lambda/proc blocks not checked** — `-> { }` and `-> do end` produce `LambdaNode` in
///    Prism, not `CallNode`. The cop only dispatched on `CALL_NODE`. Added `LAMBDA_NODE`
///    dispatch with `check_lambda_alignment` method.
/// 4. **Incorrect no_offense fixture cases** — Several fixture cases had `}` aligned with
///    the method call column (not the expression/line start), which RuboCop would flag.
///    Removed factually incorrect cases from no_offense.rb.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation findings (2026-03-19)
///
/// Root causes of remaining 6 FP:
/// 1. **Next-line dot chain** (ubicloud, 2 FP) — `}` followed by newline + `.sort_by` was
///    not detected as a chained closer because `is_closer_chained` only checked for `.`
///    immediately after the closer. Extended to check the next non-empty line for leading `.`.
/// 2. **`&&`/`||` with complex LHS** (forem, 1 FP) — `if x == "str" && y.each do ... end`
///    where `find_same_line_operator_lhs` couldn't walk backward through string literals
///    and `==` in the LHS. Made the backward walk more permissive (handles quotes, operators).
/// 3. **Multiline assignment on previous line** (pivotal, 1 FP) — `a, b =\n  stdout\n  .reduce do`
///    where `find_assignment_lhs_col` only checked the same line as the CallNode. Extended
///    to check the previous line when the call starts at line indent and prev line ends with `=`.
/// 4. **Paren/rescue context** (automaticmode, 1 FP) — `(svg = IO.popen(...) { } rescue false)`.
///    Not fixed; requires AST parent walk.
/// 5. **Splat method arg deep indentation** (flyerhzm, 1 FP) — `*descendants.map { ... }`.
///    Not fixed; requires AST parent walk.
///
/// Root causes of remaining 17 FN:
/// 1. **`expression_start_indent` too permissive** (Arachni, 6 FN + seyhunak, 3 FN + others) —
///    When a block's call expression is mid-line (e.g., inside parens like `expect(auditable.audit(...)
///    do`), the line indent matches the outer context, not the call expression. Guarded
///    `expression_start_indent` to only be accepted when `call_start_col == expression_start_indent`
///    (i.e., the call starts at the line's indent position).
/// 2. **`%` not in `find_call_expression_col` chars** (randym, 2 FN + floere, 1 FN) —
///    `%w(...)` percent literals weren't fully walked backward. Added `%` to accepted characters.
/// 3. **Lambda `call_expr_col` accepting `{` column** (refinery, 1 FN) — For lambda blocks,
///    `find_call_expression_col` gave the `{`/`do` position rather than `->`, causing `}`
///    aligned with `{` to be accepted. Removed `call_expr_col` from lambda alignment check.
/// 4. **Chained `.to_json` accepted in assignment** (diaspora, 1 FN) — Not fixed; chained
///    closer heuristic accepts `call_start_col` which matches the RHS call. Requires AST walk.
///
/// Remaining gaps: 2 FP (paren/rescue, splat-arg) + 1 FN (chained closer in assignment).
///
/// ## Corpus investigation findings (2026-03-19, round 3)
///
/// Root causes of remaining 10 FP:
/// 1. **`:` in bracket-key LHS** (vagrant-parallels x2, hashicorp/vagrant, JEG2/highline,
///    peritor/webistrano — 5 FP) — `env[:machine].id = expr do` or `entry[:phone] = ask(...) do`.
///    `skip_assignment_backward` LHS walk didn't handle `:` (symbol literal prefix inside
///    brackets), stopping at `:machine` instead of walking through to `env`. Fixed by adding
///    `:` to accepted chars and balanced paren/bracket handling in the LHS walk.
/// 2. **`<<` not handled as same-line operator** (docuseal, openstreetmap — 2 FP) —
///    `acc << expr do ... end` or `lists << tag.ul(...) do`. The `<<` shovel operator wasn't
///    recognized by `find_same_line_operator_lhs`, so `acc`'s column wasn't accepted as
///    alignment target. Added `<<` to the same-line operator check.
/// 3. **Parens not handled in LHS walk** (openstreetmap, opf/openproject — 1 FP) —
///    `RequestStore.store[key(work_package)] = value do` where `(` in the LHS stopped the
///    backward walk. Added balanced paren/bracket handling to `skip_assignment_backward`.
/// 4. Existing unfixable: paren/rescue (automaticmode, 1 FP), splat-arg (flyerhzm, 1 FP).
///
/// Root causes of remaining 7 FN:
/// 1. **Cross-line single assignment accepted** (ankane/blazer, fog, jruby/warbler — 3 FN) —
///    `@connection_model =\n  Class.new(...) do ... end` at col 8. `find_assignment_lhs_col`
///    walked to the previous line and found the assignment LHS. But RuboCop's
///    `disqualified_parent?` stops at cross-line parents (except masgn). Fixed by restricting
///    cross-line assignment detection to multi-assignment (masgn) only (detected by comma in LHS).
/// 2. **Cross-line `||`/`&&` accepted as alignment target** (sharetribe — 1 FN) —
///    `accepted_states.empty? ||\n  accepted_states.any? do ... end` at col 6.
///    `find_operator_continuation_start` accepted the indent of the `||` LHS line. But RuboCop's
///    `disqualified_parent?` stops at cross-line parents. Fixed by removing
///    `find_operator_continuation_start` entirely — cross-line operator continuations are
///    not valid alignment targets.
/// 3. **Cross-line `<<` no longer accepted** (trogdoro — 1 FN) — `threads <<\n  Thread::new(...)
///    do ... end` at col 10 matched `threads <<` line indent via `operator_continuation_indent`.
///    Removing that function fixed this FN.
/// 4. **Cross-line single assignment no longer accepted** (sup-heliotrope — 1 FN) —
///    `@files =\n  begin...end.map do ... end` at col 4. The cross-line `@files =` was
///    previously accepted; masgn restriction now rejects it.
/// 5. Existing unfixable: chained `.to_json` in assignment (diaspora, 1 FN).
///
/// Remaining gaps: 2 FP (paren/rescue, splat-arg) + 1 FN (chained closer in assignment).
///
/// ## Corpus investigation findings (2026-03-20)
///
/// Root causes of the final oracle-known gaps:
/// 1. **Rescue modifier wrapper** (automaticmode, 1 FP) — `foo { ... } rescue false`
///    should stop the ancestor walk at the current block expression, so the closer
///    aligns with the block call start rather than the outer assignment LHS.
/// 2. **Splat wrapper** (flyerhzm, 1 FP) — `wrap *items.map { ... }` aligns the
///    closer with the `*` column because RuboCop stops at the `splat` ancestor.
/// 3. **Plain chained call in assignment** (diaspora, 1 FN) — `result = items.map { ... }.to_json`
///    must NOT accept the inner call start. RuboCop walks through the normal send
///    chain to the assignment, so the closer aligns with the assignment LHS.
///
/// Fixes applied:
/// - Added `find_same_line_splat_col` so splat-wrapped block calls align to `*`
/// - Replaced the broad chained-closer escape with `accept_intermediate_call_start`,
///   which only keeps the inner call start for rescue wrappers, safe-navigation
///   chains (`&.`), and chained calls that immediately open another block
///
/// Verification:
/// - `cargo test --lib -- block_alignment` passes with new fixture coverage for all
///   three patterns
/// - `scripts/verify-cop-locations.py Layout/BlockAlignment` reports all CI-known
///   FP/FN fixed
/// - `scripts/check-cop.py Layout/BlockAlignment --verbose --rerun` still reports
///   15 excess in local batch `--corpus-check` mode, but a direct per-repo
///   nitrocop vs RuboCop sweep over all 188 active repos shows 0 count delta on
///   the 180 repos that were locally comparable. The 8 remaining repos failed
///   local RuboCop/json validation (`devdocs`, `jruby`, and 6 repos with local
///   JSON/tooling issues), so the residual batch excess is likely validation noise
///   rather than a confirmed cop-logic mismatch.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation findings (2026-03-30)
///
/// Root causes of the remaining 9 FN:
/// 1. **`call_expr_col` overrode wrapper targets** — same-line `||`, `&&`, `<<`,
///    and `*` wrappers computed the right outer target, but the fallback
///    `call_expr_col` still accepted the inner call start.
/// 2. **Wrapper-stopping parents still allowed assignment LHS** — when a block
///    closer immediately chained into another block, safe-navigation send, or
///    rescue modifier, RuboCop stopped before the outer assignment, but
///    nitrocop still accepted the assignment LHS.
/// 3. **Receiver chains ending at `}`** — `find_call_expression_col` handled
///    `)`/`]` receivers but stopped just after `}` in `}.each do` chains.
/// 4. **Multiline stabby lambdas** — `LambdaNode::location()` can start after
///    the `->` operator when lambda arguments wrap, and the line indent of a
///    mid-line `->` is not a valid alternate target.
///
/// Fixes applied:
/// - Ignore `call_expr_col` when a same-line operator or splat wrapper already
///   provides the outer alignment target
/// - Drop assignment-LHS alignment whenever the closer immediately feeds an
///   outer wrapper that RuboCop stops on, while still allowing plain `||=` and
///   `&&=` memoization blocks
/// - Walk through balanced `{...}` receivers in `find_call_expression_col`
/// - Use `LambdaNode::operator_loc()` and only accept line-indent alignment for
///   lambdas that actually start at that indent
///
/// ## Fixture sync (2026-03-30)
///
/// The remaining local `offense.rb` failure was fixture drift, not a new
/// detection gap. Raw oracle snippets had been appended without parseable Ruby
/// context, duplicating real FN examples already covered earlier in the fixture
/// and by focused unit tests. The fix is to keep the shared fixture on the
/// parseable examples rather than the orphaned snippets.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation findings (2026-04-02)
///
/// Root cause of a remaining FP cluster:
/// 1. **Line-leading closers before same-line operators** — on lines like
///    `} || rhs.any? do` or `end.values_at(...) || rhs.each do`,
///    `find_same_line_operator_lhs` treated the previous expression's closer as
///    a real same-line LHS wrapper and suppressed the valid RHS block target.
///    RuboCop instead stops before that outer operator because the left operand
///    started on a previous line.
///
/// Fix applied:
/// - Ignore `&&`/`||`/`<<` wrapper candidates when the would-be same-line LHS
///   starts with a line-leading closer (`end`, `}`, `)`, or `]`)
