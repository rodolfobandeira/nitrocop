/// ## Investigation findings (2026-03-15)
///
/// **FP root cause (208 FPs, now fixed):** `find_left_paren_on_line` was finding
/// the `(` of method calls like `gc.draw('fmt' % [...])` where the `%` operator
/// sits between `(` and `[`. The array is the RHS of `%`, not a direct argument
/// of the method call. Fix: `is_preceded_by_percent_operator()` checks if `[` is
/// immediately preceded by `%` and falls back to line-relative indent.
///
/// **FP root cause #2 (subset):** `find_left_paren_on_line` stopped at unmatched
/// `{` (hash literal) before `[`, returning `None` and using line-relative. This
/// caused missed offenses for patterns like `method({ key: [...] })` where RuboCop
/// uses paren-relative. Fix: continue scanning past unmatched `{` to find `(`.
/// `is_direct_argument` now also scans past `}` after `]` to detect hash chaining
/// (`{ key: [...] }.to_json`), correctly falling back to line-relative in that case.
///
/// **FP root cause #3 (2026-03-16, 138 FPs):** Two sub-causes:
/// a) Tab indentation: `indentation_of()` only counted spaces, returning 0 for
///    tab-indented lines. But `offset_to_line_col` counted tabs as 1 character.
///    So closing bracket `\t]` had close_col=1 but indent_base=0. Fix: use
///    `first_non_whitespace_column()` (byte offset of first non-whitespace char,
///    matching RuboCop's `source_line =~ /\S/`) for both sides of the comparison.
///    This fixed WhatWeb (~54 FPs) and phlex (~23 FPs).
/// b) Array inside hash that is chained: `method({ key: [...], k2: v }.to_json)`
///    — `is_direct_argument` checked after `]`, saw `,` (hash entry separator),
///    and returned true. But the enclosing hash is chained (`.to_json`), so
///    RuboCop uses line-relative indent. Fix: `find_left_paren_on_line` now
///    tracks unmatched `{` between `(` and `[`; when present, `is_direct_argument`
///    scans forward past hash entries to find `}`, then checks after `}`.
///    This fixed restforce (~24 FPs) and similar patterns.
///
/// **FP root cause #4 (2026-03-16):** Three additional sub-causes:
/// a) Array chained inside hash: `{ "c" => [...].compact }` — when `inside_hash`
///    is true, `is_direct_argument` scanned for `}` without first checking if `]`
///    is directly followed by `.compact`. Fix: check array chain before hash scan.
/// b) Binary operator between `(` and `[`: `(CONST + [...]).freeze` — the `(`
///    is a grouping paren, not a method call paren. Fix: `find_left_paren_on_line`
///    now detects binary operators at depth 0 between `(` and `[`.
/// c) Hash-key-relative indentation: `{ ruby: [...], js: [...] }` — elements
///    indented relative to hash key, not line start. Fix: detect hash key before
///    `[` and accept `key_col + width` / `key_col` as valid indentation.
///
/// **FP/FN root cause #5 (2026-03-18, 34 FP + 82 FN):** Three sub-causes:
/// a) String literal contents not skipped: `find_left_paren_on_line` scanned raw
///    bytes without skipping string literals. Characters like `-`, `/`, `*`, `+`
///    inside strings (e.g., `".section__in-favor"`, `'/'`) were misidentified as
///    binary operators, causing incorrect fallback to line-relative indent.
///    Fix: backward scan now skips `'...'` and `"..."` string literals.
///    This fixed ~20 FPs (decidim, vagrant, zammad, etc.) and ~10 FNs (CocoaPods,
///    endoflife, fae, oga, fluent).
/// b) Lambda `->` treated as binary minus: The `-` in `->` lambda literal was
///    detected as a subtraction operator. Fix: check if `-` is followed by `>`.
///    This fixed 12 FPs in light-service (nested `reduce_until(->(...), [...])` patterns).
/// c) Splat `*` treated as multiplication: `*[...]` and `*%w[...]` splat operators
///    were detected as binary `*`, preventing paren-relative indent.
///    Fix: `is_splat_before_array()` checks if `*` is followed by `[` or `%`.
///    This fixed ~40 FNs (rdoc, image_optim, geocoder, danbooru).
/// d) Hash-key-relative too permissive for single-pair hashes: `matches_hash_key`
///    accepted any hash-key-relative indentation, but RuboCop only accepts it for
///    multi-pair hashes. Fix: `is_multi_pair_hash()` checks for `,` + another key
///    after `]` or before the hash key on the opening line.
///    This fixed ~16 FNs (discourse single-key patterns like `requires_login except: [...]`).
///
/// **FP/FN root cause #6 (2026-03-19, 6 FP fixed):** Three sub-causes:
/// a) Grouping parens misidentified as method call parens: `assert_equal ({...})`
///    and `([...])` have `(` not preceded by a method name (preceded by space, `{`,
///    or line start). Fix: `is_grouping_paren` flag in `ParenScanResult` checks
///    the character before `(`.
/// b) Ternary `?` between `(` and `[`: `(flag ? [...] : nil)` has a ternary
///    operator at depth 0. Fix: `?` added to binary operator detection.
/// c) Byte-vs-char column mismatch: `open_col` was character-based but used as
///    byte index in `find_left_paren_on_line` and `find_hash_key_column`. For
///    multi-byte UTF-8 chars (e.g., `á` in oga repo), the byte scan started at
///    the wrong position, missing the `(`. Fix: compute `open_byte_col` from
///    byte offset arithmetic; convert results back with `byte_col_to_char_col`.
/// d) Hash-value array closing bracket: for arrays that are hash values, RuboCop
///    accepts the closing bracket at line-indent level even when paren-relative
///    is used for elements. Fix: added exemption.
///
/// **Remaining FNs (12):** Multi-pair hash arrays (ManageIQ, puppetlabs) where
/// RuboCop requires hash-key-relative as PRIMARY indentation but nitrocop uses
/// line/paren-relative. Making hash-key-relative primary caused ~600 FPs in the
/// corpus (many cases where paren-relative takes precedence). Empty array closing
/// bracket checks (markevans, gel-rb, jruby, natalie) caused similar FP regression.
/// These patterns need a more nuanced approach to `is_multi_pair_hash` that
/// distinguishes same-line vs cross-line closing bracket + next pair layouts.
///
/// **FP/FN root cause #7 (2026-03-23, 85 FP + 95 FN fixed):** Three sub-causes:
/// a) First element on same line as `[`: RuboCop's `check` returns early when
///    `same_line?(first_elem, left_bracket)`, skipping both element and closing
///    bracket checks. Nitrocop only skipped element checks but still checked
///    closing brackets, producing 83+ FPs (puppetlabs, chef, natalie, vagrant,
///    hexapdf, loomio, fluent, etc.). Fix: `return` early when `elem_line == open_line`.
/// b) Single-pair hash value closing bracket exemption in paren-relative mode:
///    The exemption at `hash_key_col.is_some() && !is_multi_pair && close_col == line_indent`
///    was applied regardless of `base_type`. For paren-relative arrays like
///    `create(:x, :groups => [...])`, RuboCop still enforces paren-relative for the
///    closing bracket. Fix: only apply exemption for `StartOfLine` base type.
///    Also added `intermediate_method_call` check: when there's a `.` between `(`
///    and the hash key (e.g., `expect(client.search body: [...])`), the paren
///    belongs to an outer call, so use line-relative indent. This fixed 95 FNs
///    (NatLabRockies/api-umbrella).
/// c) Comma-separated argument binary op false positive: `find_left_paren_on_line`
///    detected `?` in `create(flag ? :x : nil, key: [...])` as a grouping-paren
///    indicator. Fix: reset `has_binary_op` when `,` at depth 0 is encountered
///    during backward scan, since operators before commas are part of preceding
///    argument expressions. Fixed 2 FPs (antiwork/gumroad).
///
/// **FP/FN root cause #8 (2026-03-24):** Three sub-causes:
/// a) Empty arrays skipped entirely: `elements.is_empty()` returned early, skipping
///    the closing bracket check. RuboCop still checks closing brackets for empty
///    arrays (e.g., `a << [\n  ]` should flag `]`). Fix: removed early return.
/// b) Hash-key-relative not primary: RuboCop's `indent_base` checks `parent_hash_key`
///    BEFORE style-specific checks (paren-relative or line-relative). Nitrocop used
///    hash-key-relative only as a secondary acceptance fallback. Fix: added
///    `ParentHashKey` as a proper `IndentBaseType` variant and check it first when
///    the array is a hash pair value with a right sibling on a subsequent line.
///    This matches RuboCop's `right_sibling_begins_on_subsequent_line?` check.
/// c) Backward multi-pair check too permissive: `is_multi_pair_hash` backward scan
///    detected preceding hash pairs, applying hash-key-relative even for last pairs.
///    RuboCop only uses hash-key-relative when the pair has a RIGHT sibling (forward),
///    not a left sibling. Fix: backward check now requires `has_right_sibling_any_line`
///    to also be true.
/// d) `consistent` style missing hash-key-relative: RuboCop applies hash-key-relative
///    for ALL styles (except `align_brackets`), not just `special_inside_parentheses`.
///    Fix: moved hash-key-relative check before style-specific dispatch.
///
/// **FP fix / fixture repair (2026-03-30):** Arrays inside explicit
/// `super(...)` calls were treated as paren-relative by raw source scanning, so
/// nitrocop flagged `super(:only => [ ... ])` even though RuboCop accepts the
/// line-relative indentation. RuboCop only passes paren context from `on_send`;
/// `super(...)` is a `SuperNode`, so these arrays fall back to the `on_array`
/// path. Fixed by detecting when the unmatched `(` that anchors the array is
/// the `(` from `super(` and suppressing paren-relative indentation in that
/// case. Also repaired four malformed FN fixture snippets that had been pasted
/// into `offense.rb` without their enclosing Ruby context.
///
/// **FN fix (2026-03-30):** Arrays in keyword or single-pair hash arguments
/// were still missed when earlier arguments on the same call contained method
/// chains, for example `load_yaml_file(File.join(...), permitted_classes: %i[`
/// or `FactoryBot.create(... Time.now.utc, :groups => [`. The
/// `has_method_call_between` heuristic treated any top-level `.` between `(`
/// and the hash key as an "intermediate method call", even when that dot was
/// in a PREVIOUS argument separated by a comma. Fix: only consider dots in the
/// current top-level argument segment after the most recent comma.
///
/// **FP/FN root cause #9 (2026-04-01):** Four sub-causes:
/// a) Bracketless nested calls inside outer parens, e.g.
///    `with(expand_paths [ ... ])`, were treated as if the array belonged to
///    the outer `with(` call. RuboCop keeps these line-relative because the
///    array is the argument of the inner command-style call. Fix:
///    `has_command_call_before_array()` suppresses paren-relative indentation
///    when the current top-level argument segment ends with a command-style
///    method call before `[`.
/// b) Complex `=>` hash keys, e.g. `Source.new(...) => [`, were anchored to the
///    tail of the key expression (`)`), not the pair start. RuboCop uses
///    `pair.loc.column`. Fix: `find_pair_start_before_rocket()` now scans back
///    to the start of the whole hash pair expression.
/// c) Hash-key-relative indentation was still applied when the right sibling
///    started on the SAME line as the closing bracket, e.g.
///    `pageids: [ ... ], iilimit: 50`. RuboCop only uses parent-hash-key when
///    the right sibling begins on a SUBSEQUENT line. Fix: remove the backward
///    "any right sibling" heuristic and require
///    `has_right_sibling_on_subsequent_line()` directly.
/// d) Explicit `.(` call syntax, e.g. `array.([`, was misclassified as a
///    grouping paren because `(` is preceded by `.`. Fix: treat `.` as a valid
///    method-call precursor when deciding if `(` is grouping.
