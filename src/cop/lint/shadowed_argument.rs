/// Lint/ShadowedArgument: checks for method/block arguments that are reassigned
/// before being used.
///
/// ## Investigation findings
///
/// FP root cause: nitrocop did not check whether the argument was ever referenced
/// (read) in the body. RuboCop's VariableForce checks `argument.referenced?` and
/// skips unreferenced arguments. Without this, `def foo(x); x = 42; end` was
/// flagged even though `x` is never read.
///
/// FN root cause: nitrocop only scanned top-level body statements for assignments.
/// RuboCop does a deep scan of ALL assignments in the scope (including those nested
/// inside conditionals, blocks, and lambdas). When a conditional/block assignment
/// precedes an unconditional one, RuboCop reports at the declaration node (location
/// unknown). Nitrocop missed these patterns entirely because it bailed out on
/// encountering a conditional at the top level.
///
/// Additional FN: shorthand assignments (`||=`, `+=`) should stop the scan (the
/// argument is used) but should not prevent detecting a later unconditional
/// reassignment. The old code returned immediately on shorthand, which could miss
/// a subsequent shadowing write.
///
/// Additional FN: `value = super` was treated as "RHS references arg" because
/// `ForwardingSuperNode` unconditionally counted as a reference. RuboCop's
/// `uses_var?` only matches `(lvar %)`, so bare `super` does NOT count.
/// Split into `node_references_local_explicit` (no super) for RHS checks.
///
/// Additional FN: nested blocks/defs inside outer defs/blocks were never visited
/// because `visit_def_node`/`visit_block_node`/`visit_lambda_node` did not recurse
/// into their bodies. Added explicit recursion after checking parameters.
///
/// FP fix: multi-write `a, b, arg = super` was flagged because
/// `node_references_local_explicit` (used for RHS checks) does not count
/// `ForwardingSuperNode` as a reference. But bare `super` implicitly forwards
/// ALL method arguments, so the param IS used on the RHS. Fixed by checking
/// `node.value().as_forwarding_super_node().is_some()` in `visit_multi_write_node`
/// before falling through to `node_references_local_explicit`.
///
/// Additional FN (5 corpus): Three root causes:
/// 1. `collect_param_names`/`find_param_offset` did not handle `BlockParameterNode`
///    (`&block` params), causing block-pass args to be invisible to the cop entirely.
///    (chefspec FN, seeing_is_believing FN)
/// 2. `AssignmentCollector` did not handle `MultiWriteNode` (parallel/destructuring
///    assignment like `a, b = expr`). `LocalVariableTargetNode` targets inside
///    multi-writes were never collected as assignments. (xiki FN x2, brakeman FN)
/// 3. The `&&` short-circuit case (`char && block = lambda { ... }`) was already
///    handled by default visitor recursion into `AndNode`; the actual blocker was
///    cause #1 (`&block` not collected).
///
/// Additional FN (4 corpus, 2026-03-27): two root causes:
/// 1. `collect_param_names`/`find_param_offset` missed `KeywordRestParameterNode`
///    (`**options`), so shadowing of keyword-rest args was never checked.
/// 2. Prior-reference filtering was too broad: any read before the *reporting*
///    assignment suppressed offenses, including reads that occur only after an
///    earlier shadowing write. RuboCop still reports in those cases (for example,
///    conditional shadowing followed by later unconditional reassignment), so the
///    check now only considers reads before the first non-shorthand assignment that
///    writes the arg without reading it on the RHS.
///
/// FP fix (1 corpus, 2026-04-01): `Kernel#binding` implicitly references all
/// local variables in scope. RuboCop's VariableForce calls `variable.reference!`
/// on every accessible variable when it encounters a bare `binding` call. When
/// `binding` appears before the first shadowing assignment, RuboCop considers the
/// arg as referenced and does not flag it. Added detection of `binding` calls
/// (no receiver, no arguments) in `RefCollector` as implicit references, gated
/// by the `IgnoreImplicitReferences` config like `ForwardingSuperNode`.
///
/// ## Migration to VariableForce
///
/// This cop was migrated from a 687-line standalone AST visitor to use the shared
/// VariableForce engine. The cop implements `VariableForceConsumer::before_leaving_scope`
/// to check each argument variable for shadowing assignments that precede any reference.
