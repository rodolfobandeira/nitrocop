/// Checks for every useless assignment to local variable in every scope.
///
/// ## Implementation approach
///
/// RuboCop uses VariableForce, a sophisticated control-flow-aware analysis that
/// tracks individual assignments through branches, loops, rescue, etc. Our
/// implementation approximates this with a per-scope sequential analysis that:
///
/// 1. Walks statements sequentially, tracking the "last write" for each variable
/// 2. When a variable is read, marks the last write as "used"
/// 3. When a variable is written, the previous write (if not yet used) is "useless"
/// 4. For branches (if/else, case/when), merges liveness conservatively
/// 5. For loops, assumes writes may be read in the next iteration
/// 6. For blocks (closures), treats them as may-execute
///
/// ## Root causes of historical FP/FN
///
/// - FN (3,565 in corpus): The old implementation used flat variable-name-level
///   tracking ("is variable X ever read?") instead of per-assignment tracking.
///   This missed the common pattern `x = 1; puts x; x = 2` where the last
///   assignment is useless, and `x = 1; x = 2; puts x` where the first is useless.
/// - FN: Top-level scope was not analyzed at all.
/// - FN: For-loop variables were not checked.
/// - FP (503 in corpus): Various control-flow patterns where conservative
///   analysis incorrectly flagged assignments used through branches/loops.
///
/// ## Fixes applied
///
/// - FP fix: `begin/rescue` and `begin/ensure` blocks now protect pre-begin
///   writes from being marked useless during body analysis. Any statement in
///   the body could raise, so the pre-begin value may still be live when
///   control reaches the rescue/ensure or post-begin code. This fixed 270+
///   FPs from the `result = nil; begin; result = expr; rescue; end; result`
///   pattern common in Rails and other frameworks.
/// - FP fix: `class << expr` now correctly analyzes the expression as a read.
///   Previously `obj = Object.new; class << obj; end` flagged `obj` as useless
///   because the singleton class expression was not traversed for variable reads.
///
/// ## Remaining gaps (821 FP, 1425 FN as of investigation)
///
/// - FP: Multi-write targets (`a, b = expr`) where one target is unused —
///   RuboCop's VariableForce has more nuanced handling of multi-writes.
/// - FP: Complex control flow in loop bodies with if/elsif branches that
///   reset variables — the 2-pass simulation doesn't fully capture all
///   back-edge read patterns.
/// - FP: `rescue => e` where `e` is unused — some RuboCop configurations
///   suppress this detection.
/// - FN: Various patterns requiring deeper flow analysis that our sequential
///   approximation misses.
