/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-03)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=714, FN=5,610.
///
/// FN=5,610: Fixed by removing unconditional heredoc folding (commit a1d41934).
/// Heredocs are now only folded when "heredoc" is in CountAsOne (default: []).
///
/// FP=714→PASS: Fixed BeginNode off-by-one for methods with rescue/ensure
/// (commit 1901c910). Prism's BeginNode.location() starts at the def keyword,
/// not the first body statement. When the method was inside a class/module,
/// this caused effective_start_offset to include the def line in the body count.
/// Fix: for BeginNode bodies, use the first child statement's location instead.
///
/// Remaining excess (9,721) is within file-drop noise (8,174 from jruby).
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-04)
///
/// Corpus oracle currently reports FP-heavy divergence for this cop.
///
/// In this batch, additional suppression mismatches were traced to short-form
/// directives (`# rubocop:disable MethodLength`) that RuboCop resolves to this
/// cop. nitrocop now resolves short names in `parse::directives` to align with
/// RuboCop's directive handling.
///
/// Additional FP root cause: methods whose body is only a heredoc expression.
/// In Parser AST, bare heredoc bodies are `str`/`dstr` nodes whose source range
/// is only the opener line (`<<~SQL`), so RuboCop counts them as one line.
/// nitrocop previously counted full heredoc content lines for this shape.
///
/// Follow-up fixes in this batch:
/// - Handle endless methods (`def foo = ...`) instead of skipping all defs
///   without `end`.
/// - Count `define_method` blocks even when the send has a receiver
///   (`klass.define_method`, `mod.define_method`), matching RuboCop's
///   `on_block` + `node.method?(:define_method)` behavior.
///
/// Local corpus rerun comparison against unchanged baseline binary:
/// only 5 repos changed, all in the expected FN direction (+6 total offenses):
/// `ruby__typeprof` (+2), `refinery__refinerycms` (+1), `natalie-lang__natalie` (+1),
/// `opal__opal` (+1), `theforeman__foreman` (+1).
///
/// Known remaining FN examples from corpus oracle: `chef` (powershell wrapper)
/// and `jruby` (`test_lje_structure`).
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-07)
///
/// FP=112 across 31 repos. Root cause: when a method body contains heredocs,
/// RuboCop uses `source_from_node_with_heredoc(body)` which computes the line
/// range as `body.first_line..max(descendant.last_line)`. Since `each_descendant`
/// yields only children/grandchildren (not the body node itself), wrapper closing
/// keywords like block `end`s are excluded from the max. In contrast, nitrocop
/// used the method's `end` keyword line as the range boundary, which included
/// inner block `end` keywords.
///
/// Fix: when the body has heredoc descendants, compute `effective_end_offset`
/// from `max_descendant_end_line` (max of inner statements' end lines and
/// heredoc closing locations) rather than the method's `end` keyword line.
/// The function `inner_content_end_line` recursively digs into CallNode blocks
/// and StatementsNode wrappers to find the innermost content line, matching
/// RuboCop's descendant-based line range.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-08)
///
/// FP=38, FN=151. Root cause: `inner_content_end_line` was recursively digging
/// into ALL nested block bodies (including deeply nested ones), excluding their
/// `end` keywords. But in Parser AST, `body.each_descendant` only excludes the
/// root body node itself — nested block nodes ARE descendants whose `last_line`
/// includes their `end` keywords.
///
/// Key Parser/Prism structural mismatch:
/// - Parser single-statement: body = statement (block/send). `each_descendant`
///   yields statement's children, excluding the statement itself.
/// - Parser multi-statement: body = (begin stmts). `each_descendant` yields
///   all children, including block nodes with their `end`.
/// - Prism always wraps in StatementsNode, even for single statements.
///
/// Fix: `inner_content_end_line` now only unwraps one level of StatementsNode.
/// For single-child bodies, `descendants_max_end_line` visits the child's
/// immediate children (for CallNode with block: block body children; for
/// CallNode without block: args end line). For multi-child bodies, uses
/// `end_line_of` for each child. This includes nested block `end` keywords
/// while excluding the outermost body, matching `each_descendant` semantics.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-09)
///
/// Re-ran the cop under the repository's Ruby 3.4 toolchain:
/// `mise exec ruby@3.4 -- python3 scripts/check-cop.py Metrics/MethodLength
/// --verbose --rerun`.
///
/// Result:
/// - Expected: 107,344
/// - Actual:   113,392
/// - Excess:   0 over CI baseline after file-drop adjustment
/// - Missing:  0
///
/// No code change was taken in this run. The artifact-reported FP/FN counts
/// are dominated by jruby file-drop noise; with the correct rerun environment
/// the cop has no remaining missing offenses and no excess regression.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-10)
///
/// FP=28, FN=2. Root causes of FPs:
///
/// 1. **Heredoc-in-structured-node off-by-one (18 FPs):** When a method body
///    contains heredocs, nitrocop switches to `source_from_node_with_heredoc`
///    semantics, computing effective_end_offset from `max_descendant_end_line`.
///    For single-child bodies like `if`/`case`/`while` nodes,
///    `descendants_max_end_line` fell back to `end_line_of(node)` which
///    included the node's own `end` keyword. Parser's `each_descendant`
///    excludes the root node, so its `end` keyword is not counted.
///    Fix: use a Prism visitor to walk all descendants, skipping the root
///    node, matching `each_descendant` semantics.
///    Similarly, for BeginNode with ensure/rescue, the clause's
///    `location().end_offset()` included closing keywords. Fix: use the
///    clause's inner statements' end lines instead.
///
/// 2. **Directive handling (10 FPs):** thredded (6) and coreinfrastructure (4)
///    have `# rubocop:disable Metrics/MethodLength` directives that suppress
///    offenses in RuboCop. These are directive resolution issues, not cop logic.
///
/// The 2 FNs are in chef and jruby (known file-drop noise).
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-10, second pass)
///
/// FP=13, FN=2. 6 FPs are config resolution issues (rails_admin Max:29,
/// super_diff Max:114). 7 FPs are heredoc off-by-one where nitrocop counts
/// [11/10] but RuboCop counts 10. All 7 are methods with `if/else` containing
/// heredocs.
///
/// Root cause: Prism's `ElseNode` location extends to the parent's closing
/// `end` keyword. In `MaxEndLineVisitor`, visiting the `ElseNode` descendant
/// inflated `max_line` by one. Parser AST has no `ElseNode` wrapper — the
/// else branch is just a child node whose `last_line` is the last statement,
/// not the `end` keyword. Fix: skip `ElseNode` in the visitor (let its children
/// be visited instead).
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-10, third pass)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=1, FN=2.
///
/// FP=1: rubyonjets/jets `git_dirty_message` [11/10]. Method body is
/// `if/elsif` containing heredocs. Prism's elsif IfNode location extends
/// to the parent's `end` keyword (same structural issue as ElseNode).
/// Fix: skip elsif IfNode in MaxEndLineVisitor by checking if
/// `if_keyword_loc` starts with `elsif`.
///
/// FN=2: chef (single-heredoc body) and jruby (=begin/=end block comment
/// file). Both are file-drop noise — nitrocop cannot process these files
/// due to missing project structure (no Gemfile/lockfile). Not cop logic bugs.
///
/// ## Extended corpus investigation (2026-03-23)
///
/// Extended corpus (5592 repos) reported FP=76, FN=2. Standard corpus is 0/0.
///
/// FP=76 root cause: cross-cutting file-level issue. 54/76 FP from Tubalr (32)
/// and stackneveroverflow (22) with vendored gems that RuboCop cannot parse.
/// Remaining 22 FP from 12 repos — likely config resolution differences (custom
/// Max values, AllowedMethods) or vendor path exclusion edge cases.
///
/// FN=2 from brixen/poetics (bin/poetics:21) — extensionless file that nitrocop
/// does not discover. This is a file discovery issue (shebang detection), not a
/// cop logic bug. RuboCop discovers and lints these files.
///
/// ## Corpus verification (2026-03-25)
///
/// verify_cop_locations.py: FP 0 fixed / 16 remain, FN 100 fixed / 0 remain.
/// All FN verified fixed. Remaining FP=16: noosfero (4, vendored plugins),
/// ruby/tk (3, config), auth0 (2, config), dradis (1, vendored plugin),
/// ConfigLMM (1), brandur (1), engineyard (1), gisiahq (1), samvera (1),
/// siberas (1) — all config resolution or vendored file issues.
/// No cop-level fix needed.
///
/// ## Corpus FP=1 engineyard (2026-03-30)
///
/// RuboCop crashes on the `run` method in serverside_runner.rb (<<-ERROR
/// heredoc inside rescue/begin/else triggers a RuboCop bug). RuboCop
/// silently swallows the error and reports no offense; nitrocop correctly
/// reports [23/10]. File excluded via repo_excludes.json.
///
/// ## =begin/=end trailing embdoc fix (2026-03-30)
///
/// FP=7 root cause: methods containing `=begin/=end` embedded documentation
/// blocks AFTER the last body statement were over-counted. RuboCop uses
/// `body.source.lines` whose range ends at the last body statement. Any
/// content between the body and the method's `end` keyword (including
/// `=begin/=end` blocks) is outside `body.source` and not counted.
///
/// Previous fix attempt (commit 2785f494, reverted in 129fbc30) modified
/// the shared `count_body_lines_impl` to skip `=begin/=end` blocks. This
/// broke ClassLength/ModuleLength/BlockLength because those cops DO count
/// `=begin/=end` content within the body range (it appears between
/// statements, not after the last one).
///
/// Correct fix: in `count_method_lines`, use the body node's end offset
/// (not the method's `end` keyword) as `effective_end_offset` for
/// non-BeginNode, non-heredoc bodies. This shortens the counting range to
/// match `body.source.lines` without modifying the shared counting function.
/// BeginNode bodies are excluded because their location extends to the
/// method's `end` keyword, so the adjustment would be a no-op.
