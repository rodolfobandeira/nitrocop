/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-04)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=105, FN=5.
///
/// A high-volume FP pattern was blocks whose body is only a heredoc expression:
/// `render do; <<~RUBY ... RUBY; end`.
///
/// In RuboCop (Parser AST), that body is a `str`/`dstr` node whose source range
/// is just the heredoc opening line (`<<~RUBY`), so it counts as one body line.
/// Our Prism implementation counted the full physical heredoc content range,
/// producing false positives on large documentation/example blocks.
///
/// Fix: detect "single heredoc expression body" and count it as one line.
///
/// Additional investigation (same run):
/// - FN: `super do ... end` blocks were not analyzed because only `CallNode`-backed blocks were handled.
/// - FP: `Data.define(...) do ... end` constructor blocks were counted, while RuboCop exempts them like `Struct.new`.
/// - FN: brace-style blocks where the last body token shares the closing `}` line
///   (e.g. `lambda { Hash.new(...) }`) were undercounted by one line.
///
/// Fixes:
/// - Analyze `SuperNode` and `ForwardingSuperNode` blocks as method name `super`.
/// - Extend constructor exemption to include `Data.define`.
/// - When block body and closing token share a line, count that trailing body line.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-07)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=39, FN=0.
///
/// Root cause: RuboCop's `source_from_node_with_heredoc` uses `each_descendant`
/// (which excludes the body node itself) to find max last_line. When a block body
/// contains heredocs, lines belonging to the root body node (e.g. a trailing `)`
/// on its own line in `Hash.new(...)`) are excluded from the count. nitrocop was
/// using `body.location().end_offset()` which includes the full body span,
/// overcounting by 1 line in these cases.
///
/// Fix: when the body contains heredoc descendants, compute the end line as the
/// max last_line across all descendants only (via `heredoc_descendant_max_line`),
/// matching RuboCop's `source_from_node_with_heredoc` algorithm.
///
/// Result: FP=0, FN=0 (within file-drop noise).
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-08)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=28, FN=193.
///
/// FN root cause identified: `heredoc_descendant_max_line` only tracked end
/// lines for StringNode and InterpolatedStringNode descendants. When a block
/// body contained heredocs AND code after the heredoc, the descendant max line
/// was set to the heredoc terminator line, cutting off subsequent code lines.
///
/// An attempt was made to rewrite `heredoc_descendant_max_line` to track ALL
/// descendant node end lines (commit 15aeae64, reverted). The approach used
/// visit_branch_node_enter/visit_leaf_node_enter callbacks with depth tracking
/// to exclude the root body node (matching Parser's each_descendant semantics).
///
/// The fix was reverted because corpus validation produced catastrophic 130K
/// offenses (vs 19K expected). Root cause of the regression was missing bundle
/// symlinks in the worktree (bench/corpus/vendor/bundle), causing nitrocop to
/// fall back to hardcoded defaults for ALL cops, not just BlockLength. The fix
/// itself was never validated in a proper environment.
///
/// A correct fix should: (1) rewrite heredoc_descendant_max_line to track all
/// descendant types, (2) validate in an environment with proper corpus bundle
/// symlinks, (3) handle the Parser each_descendant root-exclusion semantics.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-09)
///
/// Re-applied the descendant-tracking fix in a worktree with the required
/// corpus wiring. The prior revert was environmental, not a behavioral
/// regression in the BlockLength logic.
///
/// Fix: track end lines for all descendants, not just string descendants.
/// For heredocs, continue using `closing_loc` so the terminator line matches
/// RuboCop's `loc.heredoc_end.line`. For single-statement bodies wrapped by
/// Prism `StatementsNode`, skip the wrapper and the single child expression so
/// the traversal matches Parser's `each_descendant` root exclusion.
///
/// Acceptance gate with `mise exec ruby@3.4 -- python3 scripts/check-cop.py
/// Metrics/BlockLength --verbose --rerun`:
/// - Expected: 19,376
/// - Actual:   19,248
/// - Excess:   0 over CI baseline after file-drop adjustment
/// - Missing:  128
///
/// Result: accepted. The fix recovered 65 missing offenses vs the prior CI
/// baseline (193 -> 128) without introducing false-positive regressions.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-20)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FN=3 in the extended corpus.
///
/// FN #1/#2: `BenchmarkDriver::Struct.new` blocks in benchmark-driver repo.
/// Root cause: `is_class_constructor()` used `constant_name()` which returns
/// just the last segment of a constant path — `BenchmarkDriver::Struct`
/// returned `Struct`, incorrectly matching the class constructor exemption.
/// RuboCop's `class_constructor?` uses `(const {nil? cbase} :Struct)` which
/// only matches bare `Struct` or `::Struct`, not qualified paths.
/// Fix: replaced `constant_name()` with `is_simple_constant()` calls.
///
/// FN #3: `proc do ... end` block in `bin/reak` (rkh/Reak repo). This file
/// has no `.rb` extension (shebang-only script). The cop logic correctly
/// counts proc blocks — this is a file discovery issue, not a cop logic bug.
/// Confirmed by test: `proc do ... end` blocks ARE detected in `.rb` files.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-09, second pass)
///
/// Investigated the remaining 128 FN without corpus repo access. Compared
/// RuboCop's `CodeLengthCalculator.code_length` (which uses `body.source.lines`)
/// with nitrocop's `count_block_lines` (offset-based line counting).
///
/// Found one verified FN cause: when a block's body starts on the same line
/// as the opening `do`/`{` AND that line is line 1 of the file,
/// `count_body_lines_ex` excludes it (counts from start_line+1 which is 2).
/// RuboCop's `body.source.lines` includes the opening line's body content.
/// Fix: add 1 when body_start_line == 1 && opening_line == 1.
///
/// This edge case is rare in practice (block starting on line 1 of a file),
/// so it likely explains very few of the 128 FN. The remaining FN require
/// corpus repo access to investigate — need per-repo FN examples from
/// `check-cop.py --rerun` to identify the systematic pattern.
///
/// Other investigated areas that do NOT explain the FN:
/// - Blocks with rescue/ensure: BeginNode bodies had +1 overcount (fixed 2026-03-10)
/// - heredoc_descendant_max_line: matches RuboCop's source_from_node_with_heredoc
///   for all tested patterns (single heredoc, multiple heredocs, heredoc+code)
/// - method_receiver_excluded?: not implemented but would cause FP, not FN
/// - is_single_heredoc_expression: correctly handles single-heredoc-body blocks
/// - Brace blocks with body on closing line: already handled by closing-line adjustment
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-10)
///
/// Previous investigation claimed FP=0, FN=0 on CI, but corpus oracle at
/// 7de25cc2 reported FP=36, FN=0.
///
/// Root cause: blocks with `rescue`/`ensure` were overcounted by 1 line.
/// Prism's `BeginNode` (used for blocks with rescue/ensure) has its
/// `location().start_offset()` set to the opening keyword (`do`/`def`),
/// not the first body statement. This caused `body_start_line` to equal
/// the opening line, making `count_body_lines_ex` include the `do` line
/// as a body line.
///
/// Additionally, BeginNode's `location().end_offset()` includes the `end`
/// keyword, which triggered the brace-block closing-line adjustment
/// (`body_end_line == closing_line`), adding another +1.
///
/// Fixes:
/// - Use `begin_node.statements().start_offset()` for body_start_line
///   instead of the BeginNode's own start_offset.
/// - Skip the brace-block closing-line adjustment for BeginNode bodies.
///
/// This fixes the systematic +1 overcount (19 of 36 FPs had [26/25]).
/// Remaining FPs are config resolution issues on CI (Enabled: false,
/// DisabledByDefault, higher Max) — not cop logic bugs.
///
/// Local `check-cop.py --rerun --quick`: excess=0, missing=146.
/// Full `check-cop.py --rerun`: excess=0, missing=155.
///
/// The 155 missing offenses are environmental (macOS vs Linux CI). Confirmed by:
/// 1. Removing the brace-block-with-heredoc guard entirely → identical 19,225 total
/// 2. Per-repo testing (vagrant=1244, rails=352, ruboto=40) matches RuboCop exactly
/// 3. Repos with delta (discourse: local=698 vs oracle=707, loomio: local=121 vs
///    oracle=130) show the same delta with and without the guard
///    The guard is correct — it prevents extending effective_end_offset past `}` when
///    a heredoc terminator appears after the closing brace in single-line brace blocks.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-10, third pass)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=22, FN=0. 8 ruboto FPs are already fixed
/// on main (brace-block-with-heredoc-after pattern). 1 forem FP is
/// already fixed (parenthesized directive annotation parsing).
///
/// Remaining ~13 FPs are [26/25] off-by-one: blocks with single-child
/// bodies containing heredocs. Root cause: `heredoc_descendant_max_line`
/// tracked BlockNode end_offset at depth == exclude_depth, which includes
/// the inner block's `end` keyword. In Parser AST, the body IS the block
/// node (not a separate descendant), so `each_descendant` excludes it
/// and its `end` keyword is NOT counted.
///
/// Fix: in `DescendantMaxLineFinder.track_node_end`, skip BlockNode at
/// depth == exclude_depth when single_child_body is true. This prevents
/// counting the inner block's `end` keyword, matching Parser semantics.
///
/// ## Extended corpus investigation (2026-03-23)
///
/// Extended corpus (5592 repos) reported FP=4, FN=1. Standard corpus is 0/0.
///
/// FP=4: all from Tubalr (2) and stackneveroverflow (2) — vendored gem files
/// that RuboCop cannot parse but Prism handles. Cross-cutting file-level issue.
///
/// FN=1 from rkh/Reak (bin/reak:48) — extensionless file not discovered by
/// nitrocop. File discovery issue, not cop logic.
///
/// ## Corpus verification (2026-03-25)
///
/// verify_cop_locations.py: FP 0 fixed / 1 remain, FN 52 fixed / 0 remain.
/// All FN verified fixed. Remaining FP=1: stackneveroverflow (vendored
/// rails_admin gem). No cop-level fix needed.
