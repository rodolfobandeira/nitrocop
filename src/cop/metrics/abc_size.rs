/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-04)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=269, FN=988.
///
/// FP root cause: nitrocop analyzed `define_method` with dynamic names
/// (`define_method("name_#{suffix}")`), while RuboCop's `MethodComplexity`
/// matcher only handles static `sym`/`str` method names.
///
/// FN root cause: `[]=` setter calls were not counted as assignments.
/// RuboCop's ABC calculator counts setter sends as assignments (and branches).
/// In hash-heavy methods this undercount led to missed offenses.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-07)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=191, FN=551.
///
/// FP root cause #1: CaseNode with else was counting +1 condition, but in
/// RuboCop `case` is NOT in CONDITION_NODES — only `when` nodes are. The
/// `else_branch?` method in RuboCop checks `[:case, :if]` but is only called
/// from `evaluate_condition_node` which requires the node to be in
/// CONDITION_NODES first. Since `case` isn't there, the else bonus is never
/// applied. Fix: removed CaseNode else condition counting entirely.
///
/// FP root cause #2: Score was not rounded to 2 decimal places before the
/// threshold comparison. RuboCop uses `.round(2)` in the calculator, so
/// scores like 17.003 round to 17.0 and don't fire. Fix: round score.
///
/// FN root cause: MultiWriteNode (`a, b, c = expr`) was counted as a single
/// assignment instead of counting each target individually. RuboCop's
/// `compound_assignment` method counts each non-setter child as a separate
/// assignment. Fix: iterate over lefts/rest/rights targets.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-08)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=87, FN=368.
///
/// Bug 1: KNOWN_ITERATING_METHODS was a custom list with wrong methods
/// (`times`, `upto`, `downto`, `step`, `loop`, `tap`, `then`, `yield_self`)
/// and missing many correct ones. Replaced with canonical RuboCop list from
/// `vendor/rubocop/lib/rubocop/cop/metrics/utils/iterating_block.rb`.
///
/// Bug 2: `visit_rescue_node` counted +1 condition per rescue clause, but
/// RuboCop has a single `:rescue` node wrapping all `:resbody` clauses.
/// In Prism, rescue clauses chain via `subsequent`, causing over-counting.
/// Fix: use `in_rescue_chain` flag to count only the first rescue clause.
///
/// Bug 3: Inline rescue (`expr rescue fallback`) as `RescueModifierNode`
/// was not counted as a condition. In Parser AST, `:rescue` is in
/// `CONDITION_NODES` which covers both block and inline rescue. Fix: added
/// `RescueModifierNode` to the conditions arm of `count_node()`.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-08, round 2)
///
/// Bug 1 (FN): `CallOrWriteNode` (`obj.foo ||= v`), `CallAndWriteNode`
/// (`obj.foo &&= v`), and `CallOperatorWriteNode` (`obj.foo += v`) were
/// not handled in `count_node`, falling through to `_ => {}`.
/// Fix: added match arms for these node types. `||=`/`&&=` count
/// A+1, B+1, C+1; `+=` etc. count A+1, B+1 (no condition since
/// `op_asgn` is not in `CONDITION_NODES`).
///
/// Bug 2 (FP): Pattern guards in `case/in` (`in :a if guard`) were
/// double-counting. Prism wraps the guard as an `IfNode` inside `InNode`'s
/// pattern, but RuboCop's `if_guard`/`unless_guard` are not in
/// `CONDITION_NODES`. Fix: added `visit_in_node` override with
/// `in_pattern_guard` flag to suppress IfNode/UnlessNode counting inside
/// InNode patterns.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-09)
///
/// Re-ran the cop under the repository's Ruby 3.4 toolchain:
/// `mise exec ruby@3.4 -- python3 scripts/check-cop.py Metrics/AbcSize
/// --verbose --rerun`.
///
/// Result:
/// - Expected: 65,966
/// - Actual:   69,118
/// - Excess:   0 over CI baseline after file-drop adjustment
/// - Missing:  0
///
/// No code change was taken in this run. The stale artifact FP/FN counts do
/// not represent a current excess regression once the corpus rerun uses the
/// correct Ruby/Bundler environment.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-10)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=22, FN=275. Local rerun shows 0 excess (PASS).
/// The FP/FN are per-location differences, not aggregate count mismatches.
///
/// Bug 1 (FP): `/regex/ =~ expr` was counted as a branch (CallNode with
/// name `=~`), but in Parser gem this is `match_with_lvasgn` which is NOT
/// a `:send` and thus not counted as a branch. Fix: skip branch counting
/// when CallNode `=~` has a regex literal receiver.
///
/// Bug 2 (FN): `rescue => var` was not counted as an assignment. In Parser
/// gem, the rescue reference is a `:lvasgn` (counted by `simple_assignment?`).
/// In Prism, it's a `LocalVariableTargetNode` (or other *TargetNode) inside
/// `RescueNode.reference` that was not handled. Fix: count rescue reference
/// as assignment in `visit_rescue_node`.
///
/// Bug 3 (FN): Lambda literals (`-> {}`) were not counted as branches. In
/// Parser gem, `-> {}` is `(block (send nil :lambda) ...)` and the `:lambda`
/// send counts as B+1. In Prism, `-> {}` is `LambdaNode` with no CallNode.
/// Fix: count `LambdaNode` as B+1.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-10, round 2)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=19, FN=152. Local rerun shows 0 excess (PASS).
///
/// Bug (FN): RuboCop's `compound_assignment` method for shorthand assignments
/// (||=, &&=, +=, etc.) counts non-setter `send` children as extra assignments.
/// In Parser AST, `x ||= foo` is `(or_asgn (lvasgn :x) (send nil :foo))` and
/// `compound_assignment` iterates direct children: sends that `respond_to?(:setter_method?)`
/// and are NOT setter methods get an extra A+1. In Prism, `x ||= foo` is a single
/// `LocalVariableOrWriteNode` — there is no separate lvasgn/send child, so the
/// extra assignment was missed. Fix: added `compound_assignment_extra()` that
/// extracts the `.value()` from any shorthand assignment node and checks if it's
/// a non-setter CallNode, adding A+1 when true. Applied to all variable
/// Or/And/OperatorWrite nodes and Index Or/And/OperatorWrite nodes.
///
/// This affects borderline methods (score within ~1.0 of Max) where the slight
/// undercount of assignments caused nitrocop to miss offenses that RuboCop flags.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-11)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=42, FN=34.
///
/// FN=34: CallTargetNode and IndexTargetNode (multi-write targets like
/// `r.color, r.key = ...` or `params[:x] = ...`) were not counted as branches.
/// In Parser, these are regular `:send` nodes that count as B+1. Fix: added
/// match arm for CallTargetNode/IndexTargetNode → B+1. Commit de1d816b.
///
/// FP=42: All had scores 17.03-18.25 (barely above Max=17). Root cause:
/// `compound_assignment_extra` incorrectly added A+1 for `||=`/`&&=`/`+=`
/// where the value is a method call WITH A BLOCK. In Parser AST, `x ||=
/// items.detect { |i| ... }` is `(or_asgn lvasgn (block (send ...)))` — the
/// `:block` wrapper doesn't respond to `setter_method?`, so RuboCop's
/// `compound_assignment` skips it. In Prism, the `.value()` is the CallNode
/// directly (block is a child), so our code saw it as a non-setter call and
/// incorrectly added A+1. Fix: skip CallNodes that have a block in
/// `compound_assignment_extra`.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-11, session 4)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=19, FN=17.
///
/// Bug 1 (FP, ~13 of 19): it-blocks (Ruby 4.0 `it` implicit parameter) and
/// numblocks (`_1`/`_2` numbered parameters) were counted as iterating block
/// conditions (C+1), but RuboCop's Parser gem produces `:itblock`/`:numblock`
/// node types which are NOT in `COUNTED_NODES`. Only regular `:block` and
/// `:block_pass` count. In Prism, all blocks are `BlockNode` — fixed by
/// checking `parameters()` for `ItParametersNode`/`NumberedParametersNode`
/// and skipping the condition count for those. Same pattern as
/// CyclomaticComplexity and PerceivedComplexity (already fixed).
///
/// Bug 2 (FP, ~5 of 19): `ImplicitRestNode` in multi-write (`relay, = expr`)
/// was counted as an assignment (A+1), but it has no variable target. In
/// Parser gem, `relay, = expr` has `(mlhs (lvasgn :relay))` — no rest node
/// at all. In Prism, the trailing comma produces `ImplicitRestNode` which was
/// not being skipped. Fixed by checking `as_implicit_rest_node()`.
///
/// Remaining after session 4: ~1 FP, 17 FN — all near threshold 17.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-11, session 5)
///
/// Bug 1 (FN): Call compound assignments (`obj.foo ||= v`, `obj.foo &&= v`,
/// `obj.foo += v`) were not handled by `compound_assignment_extra`. In Parser,
/// these are `(or_asgn (send obj :foo) v)` — `compound_assignment` counts ALL
/// non-setter send children as A+1 (both target send and value send). The
/// target send's `setter_method?` returns false (no `loc.operator`), so it IS
/// counted. The target A+1 was already handled by `count_node` for
/// `CallOrWriteNode` etc., but the value send's A+1 was missing. Fix: added
/// `CallOrWriteNode`, `CallAndWriteNode`, `CallOperatorWriteNode` to
/// `compound_assignment_extra`.
///
/// Bug 2 (FP): `begin...end while cond` / `begin...end until cond` post-
/// condition loops were counted as C+1. In Parser gem, these produce
/// `:while_post`/`:until_post` which are NOT in `COUNTED_NODES`. In Prism,
/// they are `WhileNode`/`UntilNode` with `is_begin_modifier() == true`.
/// Fix: skip condition count when `is_begin_modifier()` is true.
///
/// Bug 3 (FN): `&block` parameters in nested defs/blocks were not counted
/// as A+1. Prism's generated `visit_parameters_node` calls
/// `visit_block_parameter_node` directly instead of through `visitor.visit()`,
/// bypassing `visit_leaf_node_enter`. Fix: override `visit_block_parameter_node`
/// in AbcCounter.
///
/// Bug 4 (FN): `compound_assignment_extra` skipped block_pass calls. In Parser,
/// `x ||= items.map(&:strip)` has `block_pass` as a child of the send (not a
/// `:block` wrapper). RuboCop's compound_assignment DOES count this as A+1. In
/// Prism, `map(&:strip)` has `block: BlockArgumentNode` (not BlockNode). Fix:
/// only skip compound_extra when `.block()` is a `BlockNode`, not `BlockArgumentNode`.
///
/// Bug 5 (FN): `IndexOrWriteNode` / `IndexAndWriteNode` compound_assignment
/// undercounted. In Parser, `@h[k] ||= v` produces `(or_asgn (send :[] k) v)`.
/// RuboCop's `compound_assignment` counts BOTH children: the `[]` target (A+1)
/// and the value (A+1 if non-setter call). Our old code only counted the value
/// side via `compound_assignment_extra`. Fix: `compound_assignment_extra` now
/// returns +1 for the target `[]` plus +1 for the value. The `count_node` arm
/// for IndexOrWriteNode was also changed to NOT add A+1 (matching RuboCop's
/// `assignment?` returning false for `shorthand_asgn?` nodes).
///
/// Bug 6 (FN): `ForNode` undercounted assignments by 1. In Parser, `for x in
/// items` is `(for (lvasgn :x) (send nil :items) body)`. Both `for_type?` (A+1)
/// and the child `(lvasgn :x)` (A+1 via `simple_assignment?`) are counted. In
/// Prism, the index is `LocalVariableTargetNode` which has no `count_node` arm.
/// Fix: ForNode handler now does A+=2 instead of A+=1.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-14)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=0, FN=3.
///
/// Bug 1 (FN): Interpolated regex `=~` was incorrectly skipped. In Parser gem,
/// only non-interpolated `/literal/ =~ expr` produces `match_with_lvasgn` (NOT
/// a `:send`). Interpolated `/#{ x }/ =~ expr` is `(send (regexp ...) :=~ expr)`
/// and IS counted as B+1. nitrocop was skipping both. Fix: only skip
/// `RegularExpressionNode` receivers, not `InterpolatedRegularExpressionNode`.
///
/// Bug 2 (FN): Nested `begin...rescue...end` inside a rescue body was not
/// counted as C+1. The `in_rescue_chain` flag (designed to prevent chained
/// `rescue` clauses from double-counting) remained true while visiting the
/// rescue body, suppressing nested rescues. Fix: manually visit rescue
/// children, resetting `in_rescue_chain=false` for the body while keeping it
/// true for `subsequent` chained clauses.
///
/// Note: backtick xstring (`` `cmd` ``) does NOT count as a branch. In Parser
/// gem, `` `cmd` `` is `(xstr ...)`, NOT `(send nil :` `` ` `` ` ...)`. Only
/// the explicit `Kernel.` `` ` `` `(cmd)` form is a `:send`.
///
/// All 3 FN fixed. FP=0 confirmed via verify-cop-locations.py.
///
/// ## Corpus verification (2026-03-25)
///
/// verify_cop_locations.py: FP 0 fixed / 6 remain, FN 94 fixed / 6 remain.
///
/// FP=6 remaining: auth0 (2, config resolution — project .rubocop.yml Exclude
/// patterns not loaded identically), gisiahq (1, config), noosfero (3, vendored
/// plugin files). All infrastructure, not cop logic.
///
/// FN=6 remaining at that time: Coursemology (6). Root cause was
/// `# rubocop:disable Metrics/abcSize` (lowercase `a`) at line 2. RuboCop
/// still reports `Metrics/AbcSize` there, but nitrocop's directive matcher
/// then resolved cop names too broadly and suppressed the offenses. This was a
/// directive-resolution edge case, not an ABC counter bug, and was later fixed
/// centrally in commit `8eba06ba` by matching RuboCop-style directive
/// qualification semantics.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-28)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=0, FN=7 (6 Coursemology + 1 websocket-ruby).
///
/// FN=6 Coursemology: same case-sensitive directive issue as 2026-03-25.
///
/// FN=1 websocket-ruby: `keys += super` in compound assignment was not counting
/// `super`/`zsuper` as an extra assignment. In RuboCop's Parser AST, `SuperNode`,
/// `ForwardingSuperNode`, and `YieldNode` include `MethodDispatchNode`, so they
/// respond to `setter_method?` (returning false). RuboCop's `compound_assignment`
/// counts all children that `respond_to?(:setter_method?) && !setter_method?` as
/// extra A+1. In Prism these are separate node types (not CallNode), so
/// `value_compound_extra` didn't catch them. Fix: added checks for
/// `ForwardingSuperNode`, `SuperNode`, and `YieldNode` in `value_compound_extra`.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-29)
///
/// Re-verified the 6 remaining Coursemology FN against the real repository
/// checkout at commit `70d42e79b7d074c25453b1d97a76495b92b60ddc`.
///
/// Both offending files begin with `# rubocop:disable Metrics/abcSize`
/// (lowercase `a`). RuboCop still reports the `Metrics/AbcSize` offenses on
/// those files, proving the directive spelling does NOT suppress the cop there.
/// Removing only that directive line made nitrocop report the same offenses
/// immediately, confirming the ABC counter itself was already correct for
/// those methods.
///
/// No counting logic change was needed in this cop. The mismatch was in
/// directive resolution and was later fixed centrally in commit `8eba06ba`.
