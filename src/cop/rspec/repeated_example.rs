/// RSpec/RepeatedExample: Don't repeat examples (same body) within an example group.
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-04):** 88 FPs caused by `its()` calls with different string
/// attributes but same block body being treated as duplicates. The `example_body_signature()`
/// function was skipping the first string arg (treating it as a description like `it`), but
/// for `its`, the first string arg is the attribute accessor (e.g., `its('Server.Version')`).
/// Fix: include the first string arg in the signature when the method is `its`.
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-05):** 893 FNs and 22 FPs caused by raw source-text comparison
/// for example body signatures. RuboCop uses AST structural equality, meaning examples with
/// the same AST but different formatting (e.g., `do..end` vs `{ }`, different indentation,
/// semicolons vs newlines) are correctly identified as duplicates. Raw source comparison
/// missed all of these.
///
/// Root cause of FNs: identical example bodies with different whitespace/formatting produced
/// different raw source signatures, so they were not detected as duplicates.
///
/// Root cause of FPs: metadata args (like `:focus` tags) were compared as raw source text
/// which could accidentally match in edge cases.
///
/// Fix: replaced raw source comparison with AST-based structural fingerprinting. The new
/// `AstFingerprinter` walks the AST recursively, emitting node type tags and literal values
/// (strings, symbols, integers, identifiers) but ignoring whitespace and source locations.
/// This produces a canonical representation matching RuboCop's AST equality semantics.
///
/// The signature now consists of:
/// 1. Metadata args (everything after the first string description arg) — AST fingerprint
/// 2. Block body (the implementation) — AST fingerprint
/// 3. For `its()` calls, the first arg (attribute accessor) is also included
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-10):** 302 FPs and 705 FNs remaining.
///
/// FN root cause: nitrocop only checked direct children of the example group's StatementsNode
/// for examples. RuboCop's `ExampleGroup#examples` uses `find_all_in_scope` which recursively
/// searches the AST for examples, stopping only at scope changes (nested example groups,
/// shared groups, includes) or at other examples. Examples nested inside control flow
/// (if/unless/case), arbitrary method call blocks, or other non-scope-changing constructs
/// were missed entirely.
/// Fix: implemented recursive example collection matching RuboCop's `find_all_in_scope` logic.
///
/// FP root cause 1: block-less example calls (e.g., `it "is pending"` without a block) were
/// treated as examples. RuboCop's `example?` matcher requires a block: `(block (send nil? ...))`.
/// Two block-less calls with similar metadata would produce false duplicate reports.
/// Fix: only consider calls that have a block node as examples.
///
/// FP root cause 2: example calls with explicit receivers (e.g., `object.it { ... }`) were
/// treated as examples. RuboCop requires `nil?` receiver (bare method call).
/// Fix: skip calls that have a receiver.
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-11):** 354 FPs and 217 FNs remaining.
///
/// FP root cause: The fingerprinter did not distinguish between "no arguments" (metadata=nil
/// in RuboCop) and "has doc string only" (metadata=[] in RuboCop). In Ruby, `nil != []`, so
/// `it { body }` and `it "desc" { body }` are NOT duplicates. The old code treated both as
/// having empty metadata, producing the same fingerprint.
/// Fix: emit different marker bytes for no-args (0xFE) vs has-args (0xFD).
///
/// FN root cause: The fingerprinter only skipped the first argument when it was a string type
/// (StringNode or InterpolatedStringNode). RuboCop's `extract_metadata` pattern `(send _ _ _ $...)`
/// always skips the first argument regardless of type (it's the doc string). When the first arg
/// was a symbol, hash, or other non-string type, nitrocop included it in the fingerprint,
/// making structurally identical examples (differing only in their doc string arg) appear unique.
/// Fix: always skip the first argument for non-`its` calls, regardless of type.
///
/// For `its()` calls, the first argument is an attribute accessor and IS significant. RuboCop
/// appends `definition.arguments` to the signature separately. Updated to match: skip first arg
/// in metadata (like all examples), then append the full arguments list in a separate section.
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-11, round 2):** 346 FPs and 36 FNs remaining.
///
/// FP root cause: The `AstFingerprinter` was missing custom visitors for many leaf-like AST
/// nodes that have meaningful attribute values (names, operators) stored as non-child fields.
/// Prism's default visitor implementations for these nodes are no-ops or only visit child
/// expressions, losing the attribute values. This caused structurally different examples to
/// produce identical fingerprints, leading to false duplicate reports.
///
/// Specific gaps fixed:
/// 1. **Safe navigation (`&.`)**: `visit_call_node` only checked `call_operator_loc().is_some()`,
///    treating both `.` and `&.` as `1`. RuboCop uses `(send ...)` vs `(csend ...)` — different
///    node types. Fix: emit `2` for `&.` vs `1` for `.`.
/// 2. **Block parameter names**: `RequiredParameterNode`, `OptionalParameterNode`,
///    `RestParameterNode`, `BlockParameterNode`, `KeywordRestParameterNode`, and keyword
///    parameter nodes all have `name` attributes that default visitors don't emit.
///    Fix: added custom visitors that emit the parameter name.
/// 3. **Range operators**: `RangeNode` uses a flags field to distinguish `..` (inclusive) from
///    `...` (exclusive). Default visitor only visits left/right. Fix: emit operator source.
/// 4. **Operator write nodes**: `LocalVariableOperatorWriteNode` and similar nodes have `name`
///    and `binary_operator` attributes. Default visitor only visits the value expression.
///    Fix: added visitors for all operator/and/or write and target node types.
/// 5. **Variable target nodes**: `LocalVariableTargetNode` (multi-assign `a, b = ...`) and
///    similar target nodes have names that default visitors don't emit.
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-14, round 5):** 82 FPs and 34 FNs remaining.
///
/// FP root cause: `AndNode` (`&&`/`and`) and `OrNode` (`||`/`or`) had no custom visitors in
/// `AstFingerprinter`. When either node appears as a *child* of another node (e.g., inside
/// `DefinedNode` as `defined?(a && b)`), the parent's default visitor calls
/// `self.visit(&child)` directly — bypassing `fingerprint_node` — so no type tag is emitted
/// for the child. Since `AndNode` and `OrNode` have the same child structure (left, right),
/// both produce identical byte sequences and examples using `&&` vs `||` are incorrectly
/// flagged as duplicates. Fix: added `visit_and_node` (emits byte 1) and `visit_or_node`
/// (emits byte 2) to disambiguate them.
///
/// The same missing-type-tag pattern also applies to `IfNode`/`UnlessNode` and
/// `WhileNode`/`UntilNode` pairs. Added custom visitors for all four to prevent future FPs
/// if examples using `if` vs `unless` or `while` vs `until` appear in the corpus.
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-15):** 58 FPs and 42 FNs remaining.
///
/// FP root cause: The `AstFingerprinter` had a fundamental issue with leaf node type
/// distinction. When composite nodes use the default Visit trait implementation to visit
/// their children, they call `self.visit(&child)`, which dispatches to the type-specific
/// `visit_*_node` method but does NOT emit a type tag. For leaf nodes with no custom
/// visitor (whose default `visit_*_node` is a no-op), structurally different child nodes
/// produce identical (zero) bytes, making them indistinguishable. Examples:
/// - `defined?(__FILE__)` vs `defined?(__LINE__)` vs `defined?(__ENCODING__)`: SourceFileNode,
///   SourceLineNode, SourceEncodingNode are all no-op leaf visitors producing 0 bytes.
/// - `(not(false)).should` vs `(not(nil)).should`: FalseNode and NilNode both produce 0 bytes.
///
/// Fix: Overrode `visit_branch_node_enter` and `visit_leaf_node_enter` hooks in the Visit
/// trait to emit `node_type_tag` for EVERY node visited. This ensures all nodes get type
/// tags regardless of how they're reached (via `fingerprint_node` or via a parent's default
/// visitor). Removed redundant manual type tag emissions from custom visitors since the
/// hooks now handle this universally.
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-14):** 168 FPs and 34 FNs remaining.
///
/// FP root cause 1: The `AstFingerprinter::visit_call_node` did not emit a block presence
/// marker. A call with an empty block `call {}` and the same call without a block `call`
/// both produced the same fingerprint: `visit_block_node` emits nothing for an empty block
/// (no params, no body), and if there is no block, it's simply not called. The result is
/// that `any? {}` and `any?` in the example body were treated as identical.
/// Fix: emit a block presence/type byte (0=no block, 1=BlockNode, 2=BlockArgumentNode) in
/// `visit_call_node` before calling the default visitor.
///
/// FP root cause 2: `MatchPredicateNode` (i.e., `value in pattern`), `MatchRequiredNode`
/// (`value => pattern`), and `InNode` (`case x; in pattern; end`) all call
/// `visitor.visit(&node.pattern())` in their default implementations, without emitting the
/// pattern's type tag. For empty patterns (`[]` = ArrayPatternNode, `{}` = HashPatternNode),
/// both default visitors are no-ops — the patterns produce zero bytes and become
/// indistinguishable. Observed in dry-rb: `(None() in [])` vs `(None() in {})` both
/// produced the same fingerprint. Fix: added custom visitors for all three nodes that emit
/// the pattern's type tag before delegating to the default visitor.
///
/// FP root cause 3 (minor): `&(proc do ... end)` syntax uses `BlockArgumentNode` instead
/// of `BlockNode`. The `example_body_signature` function only fingerprinted `BlockNode`
/// bodies, silently producing an empty body signature for BlockArgumentNode. Two `it` calls
/// using different `&proc` expressions would be treated as duplicates.
/// Fix: when block is a `BlockArgumentNode`, fingerprint its `.expression()`.
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-11, round 3):** 279 FPs and 36 FNs remaining.
///
/// FP root cause: The `AstFingerprinter` was missing custom visitors for several leaf-like
/// node types that have meaningful attribute values not exposed as child nodes. These nodes
/// use the default visitor which is a no-op (no children to visit), causing structurally
/// different AST subtrees to produce identical fingerprints.
///
/// Specific gaps fixed:
/// 1. **Regex flags**: `RegularExpressionNode`, `InterpolatedRegularExpressionNode`,
///    `MatchLastLineNode`, `InterpolatedMatchLastLineNode` all have flags (i, m, x, etc.)
///    stored in `closing_loc()`. The fingerprinter only emitted `unescaped()` (pattern content)
///    without flags, so `/pattern/i` and `/pattern/m` produced identical fingerprints.
///    In RuboCop AST, regex flags are part of the `(regopt ...)` child node.
///    Fix: emit `closing_loc()` which contains the flags portion (e.g., `/im`).
/// 2. **Back reference read nodes** (`$&`, `$``, `$'`, `$~`): `BackReferenceReadNode` has a
///    `name` attribute but the default visitor is a no-op. All back references produced the
///    same fingerprint. Fix: emit `name()`.
/// 3. **Numbered reference read nodes** (`$1`, `$2`, etc.): `NumberedReferenceReadNode` has a
///    `number` attribute. Fix: emit `number()` as little-endian bytes.
/// 4. **XString nodes** (backtick strings): `XStringNode` has `unescaped()` content but the
///    default visitor is a no-op. Fix: emit `unescaped()`.
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-14, round 4):** 168 FPs remaining.
///
/// FP root cause 1: `ParametersNode` children are visited by the default generated visitor
/// which calls `self.visit(child)` without emitting each child's type tag. This means
/// `OptionalKeywordParameterNode(b:)` (from `-> *a, b: {}`) and `KeywordRestParameterNode(b)`
/// (from `-> *a, **b {}`) both emit just "b" bytes — they're indistinguishable.
/// Fix: added `visit_parameters_node` that emits a type tag for each parameter before
/// visiting it, matching the approach used in `visit_statements_node`.
///
/// FP root cause 2: Several `||=` and `&&=` write node types were missing custom visitors
/// that emit the variable/constant name. `ClassVariableOrWriteNode`, `ClassVariableAndWriteNode`,
/// `ConstantOrWriteNode`, `ConstantAndWriteNode`, `ConstantOperatorWriteNode`,
/// `GlobalVariableOrWriteNode`, `GlobalVariableAndWriteNode` all have `name: constant` as
/// an attribute (not a child node), but the default visitor only visits `value`. This caused
/// structurally different expressions like `defined?(@@a ||= true)` and `defined?(A ||= true)`
/// to produce identical fingerprints — both emitted only the right-hand side.
/// Fix: added custom visitors for all missing write node types to emit the variable name.
///
/// **Investigation (2026-03-19):** 8 FPs and 46 FNs remaining.
///
/// FP root cause 1: `CallOperatorWriteNode` (`a.b += 1`) had no custom visitor. The default
/// visitor only visits receiver and value, missing `read_name`, `write_name`, and `operator`
/// attributes. This caused `app.connections += 1` and `app.connections -= 1` to produce
/// identical fingerprints. Fix: added `visit_call_operator_write_node` that emits all three
/// attributes plus `visit_call_and_write_node` / `visit_call_or_write_node`.
///
/// FP root cause 2: No structural boundary markers in `StatementsNode`. When a block body
/// has N children, their fingerprints are simply concatenated. This means `[A B] C` (inner
/// block with 2 stmts, outer with 1) produces the same bytes as `[A B C]` (inner block
/// with 3 stmts). Observed in jruby/natalie `open_spec.rb` where `raise Exception` inside
/// vs outside an inner block produced identical fingerprints.
/// Fix: emit child count in `visit_statements_node` before visiting children.
///
/// FN root cause 1: `IntegerNode` and `FloatNode` used source text as fingerprint value.
/// Parser gem normalizes literals to their parsed values: `0` == `00`, `-0.0` == `0.0`.
/// Prism preserves source text (`"-0.0"` vs `"0.0"`), causing different fingerprints for
/// semantically identical values.
/// Fix: parse integer/float values from source and emit canonical representations.
/// For floats, normalize `-0.0` to `0.0` since `-0.0 == 0.0` in Ruby.
///
/// FN root cause 2: `KeywordHashNode` vs `HashNode` difference. Prism uses `KeywordHashNode`
/// for implicit hash args (`foo(a: 1)`) and `HashNode` for explicit (`foo({a: 1})`). Parser
/// gem normalizes both to `s(:hash, ...)`. The `visit_branch_node_enter` hook emitted
/// different type tags for these node types.
/// Fix: normalize `KeywordHashNode` type tag to `HashNode` tag in `normalized_type_tag()`.
///
/// FN root cause 3: `UnlessNode` vs `IfNode` normalization. Parser gem normalizes
/// `unless cond then A else B end` to `if cond then B else A end` — the branches are
/// swapped. Also normalizes empty else clauses to nil (same as no else).
/// Fix: rewrote `visit_unless_node` to swap branches and `visit_if_node` to normalize
/// empty else clauses, matching Parser gem's output.
///
/// FN root cause 4: `DefNode` not handled in `iter_child_nodes`. Examples inside method
/// definitions (like `def self.impersonates_a(klass); it { ... }; end`) were not found
/// because the recursive example collection didn't recurse into method bodies.
/// Fix: added `DefNode` case to `iter_child_nodes`.
