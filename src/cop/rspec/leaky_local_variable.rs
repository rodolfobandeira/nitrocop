/// Flags local variable assignments at the example-group level that are then
/// referenced inside examples, hooks, let, or subject blocks. Use `let` instead.
///
/// ## Root cause of previous FP/FN gap (23 FP, 933 FN)
///
/// The old implementation only collected direct `LocalVariableWriteNode` children
/// of the block body (top-level statements). Assignments nested inside
/// `if`/`unless`/`case`/`begin` or iterator blocks were missed (933 FN).
///
/// FPs came from not properly handling block parameter shadowing and variables
/// used only in example descriptions/metadata.
///
/// ## Current approach
///
/// Instead of VariableForce (which RuboCop uses), we take a pragmatic approach:
/// 1. When visiting an example group block, recursively collect ALL local variable
///    assignments within the block body, stopping at scope boundaries (examples,
///    hooks, let, subject, nested example groups).
/// 2. For each assignment, check if the variable is referenced inside any example
///    scope (examples, hooks, let, subject, includes args).
/// 3. Exclude "allowed" references: variables used only in example descriptions,
///    metadata keyword args, `it_behaves_like` first arg, or interpolated
///    string/symbol args to includes methods.
/// 4. Respect block parameter shadowing throughout.
///
/// ## Investigation (FP=41, FN=409, 2026-03-10)
///
/// **FP fix: reassignment-before-use (41 FPs)**
/// RuboCop's VariableForce performs flow-sensitive analysis, tracking that a
/// variable reassigned inside an example block before any read creates a new
/// binding that doesn't reference the outer scope. Our implementation now checks
/// `var_written_before_read_in_stmts` to suppress offenses when the first mention
/// of the variable in the block is an unconditional write.
///
/// **FN fix: missing `include_context` (contributes to 409 FNs)**
/// `is_includes_method` was missing `include_context`. RuboCop's `Includes.all`
/// includes both `Examples` (`it_behaves_like`, `it_should_behave_like`,
/// `include_examples`) and `Context` (`include_context`). Variables passed as
/// non-first args to `include_context` should be flagged.
///
/// **Remaining FN gap:** The bulk of the 409 FNs likely comes from cases where
/// RuboCop's VariableForce tracks variable references across Ruby scope
/// boundaries that our AST-walking approach doesn't replicate (e.g., variables
/// assigned before the top-level `describe` block, complex flow-sensitive
/// reassignment patterns). A full VariableForce implementation would close this
/// gap but is a significant engineering effort.
///
/// ## Investigation (FP=32, FN=409, 2026-03-11)
///
/// **FN fix: file-level variables (major FN source)**
/// Added `check_source` to detect variables assigned at file level (outside
/// describe blocks) that are referenced inside example scopes within describe
/// blocks. Corpus FN examples showed patterns like `spec_helper/xcscheme.rb:5`
/// where variables are assigned at line 2-6 before any describe block.
/// Implementation uses `check_file_level_vars` which collects file-level
/// assignments and checks them against all describe blocks in the file.
///
/// **FP fix: begin-block reassignment (reduces remaining FPs)**
/// Improved `is_unconditional_var_write` to recurse into `begin` blocks and
/// parenthesized expressions. A write inside `begin; x = ...; end` at the
/// start of an example block means the outer variable is never read, matching
/// RuboCop's VariableForce behavior.
///
/// **Remaining gaps:** 32 FPs from prior cycle likely involve complex
/// reassignment patterns (e.g., reassignment after non-reading statements,
/// or inside rescue blocks). 409 FNs from prior cycle partially addressed
/// by file-level variable detection; remaining FNs likely from VariableForce's
/// comprehensive scope tracking that we don't fully replicate.
///
/// ## Investigation (FP=53, FN=75, 2026-03-12)
///
/// **FN fix: operator-write nodes (`x += 1`, `x -= 1`, etc.)**
/// `LocalVariableOperatorWriteNode` was not handled in `node_references_var`,
/// `node_reads_var`, or `collect_assignments_in_scope`. Operator-writes both
/// read and write the variable (`x += 1` is `x = x + 1`). Inside example
/// blocks, `x += 1` was invisible as a reference to outer `x`. At group
/// level, `x += 1` was not collected as an assignment. Added handling for
/// all three functions.
///
/// **FN fix: interpolated regular expressions (`/#{x}/`)**
/// `InterpolatedRegularExpressionNode` was not handled in `node_references_var`.
/// Variables used only in regex interpolation inside example blocks were missed.
///
/// **FN fix: `for` loops in `node_references_var`**
/// `ForNode` was handled in `collect_assignments_in_scope` but not in
/// `node_references_var`, so variable references inside for-loop bodies
/// were invisible.
///
/// ## Investigation (FP=53, FN=64, 2026-03-14)
///
/// No example locations available in corpus data. Investigated by comparing
/// implementations and vendor spec.
///
/// **FP fix: file-level variable shadowed by group-level reassignment**
/// `check_var_used_in_describe_blocks` (used by `check_source` for file-level
/// variables) was using `check_var_used_in_example_scopes` to detect if a
/// file-level variable is referenced inside a describe block's example scopes.
/// It was NOT checking whether the variable was unconditionally reassigned at
/// the describe group's scope level before any example reference. This caused
/// false positives when a file-level variable was reassigned at the group scope
/// (making the file-level value dead), but the group-level assignment's value
/// was then used in examples.
///
/// Fix: added a `var_reassigned_before_example_ref_in_stmts` check at the top
/// of the describe block's statement traversal in `check_var_used_in_describe_blocks`.
/// If the variable is unconditionally reassigned at the group's top-level scope
/// before any example scope reference, the file-level assignment is considered
/// dead and no offense is reported for it. The group-level reassignment would
/// itself be detected and reported separately by `check_node` / `check_scope_for_leaky_vars`.
///
/// **Remaining gaps:**
/// - Any FPs from the prior investigation cycle that stemmed from complex
///   VariableForce flow analysis (e.g., conditional assignments, `begin/rescue`
///   paths) are not addressed without implementing a full VariableForce equivalent.
/// - The 64 FNs likely stem from the same root cause: RuboCop's VariableForce
///   tracks variable lifetime across all Ruby scope boundaries, while our
///   AST-walking approach uses heuristics for common patterns.
///
/// ## Investigation (FP=53, FN=75, 2026-03-15)
///
/// **FP fix: flow-aware dead assignment analysis**
/// RuboCop's VariableForce tracks per-assignment references: if a variable
/// assigned at group scope is unconditionally reassigned inside an example
/// scope (e.g., a `before` hook or `it` block) before being read, subsequent
/// example-scope reads belong to the example-scope assignment, not the
/// group-level one. Common patterns:
///   - `result = nil` at group scope, `result = compute()` in `before` hook
///   - `data = []` at group scope, `data = [1,2,3]` in first `it` block,
///     `expect(data)` in second `it` block
///
/// Our previous implementation (`check_var_used_in_example_scopes_with_reassign`)
/// checked each example scope independently but didn't do linear flow analysis
/// across statements. The new `var_value_reaches_example_scope_in_stmts` walks
/// statements linearly after the assignment, tracking whether the group-level
/// value has been "killed" by an example-scope reassignment. Once killed,
/// subsequent example-scope reads don't count as references to the group-level
/// assignment.
///
/// **Remaining gaps:**
/// - FPs from rswag/swagger DSL patterns (discourse): variables assigned inside
///   `post`/`response` blocks (non-standard DSL methods) are collected as
///   group-level assignments. These may require recognizing rswag DSL methods
///   as scope boundaries.
/// - FPs from `||=` and flow-through reassignment at file level (dev-sec):
///   `flags = parse(...)`, `flags ||= ''`, `flags = flags.split(' ')` —
///   requires tracking that `||=` and reads-then-writes are different from
///   unconditional writes.
/// - 75 FNs: VariableForce's comprehensive scope tracking across all Ruby
///   scope boundaries that our AST-walking approach doesn't replicate.
///
/// ## Investigation (FP=38, FN=286, 2026-03-19)
///
/// **FP fix: block parameter shadowing in reference checks**
/// `stmt_example_scope_var_interaction`, `check_var_used_in_example_scopes`,
/// and `check_var_used_in_describe_blocks` all recurse into "other calls with
/// blocks" (e.g., `.each do |x| ... end`) without checking if the block has a
/// parameter that shadows the variable. This caused FPs when a variable
/// assigned in one `.each` block was referenced in a later `.each` block where
/// the same name was a block parameter (openproject pattern: `schema_name`
/// assigned in first `.each`, shadowed by block param in second `.each`).
/// Fix: added `block_has_param` check before recursing into block bodies.
///
/// **FP fix: `collect_file_level_assignments` stopping at example scopes**
/// The function recursed into example scope methods (`it`, `before`, `let`,
/// `subject`, etc.) collecting assignments inside them as "file-level" vars.
/// This caused FPs for non-describe-block wrappers like
/// `Capybara::SpecHelper.spec` where `it` blocks with local vars were
/// incorrectly collected as file-level assignments.
/// Fix: added `is_example_scope` and `is_includes_method` checks.
///
/// **FP fix: dead file-level assignment filtering**
/// File-level variables assigned multiple times (e.g., `flags = parse(...)`,
/// `flags ||= ''`, `flags = flags.split(' ')`) were all flagged when only the
/// last unconditional assignment's value reaches examples. Added
/// `filter_dead_file_level_assignments` using `is_unconditional` tracking on
/// `VarAssign` to mark `||=`, `&&=`, and `+=`-style writes as conditional.
/// Earlier assignments with a later unconditional assignment (and no
/// describe-block reference between them) are filtered as dead.
///
/// **Remaining FP gaps (estimate ~20-25 remaining):**
/// - rswag/discourse FPs: variables inside `post`/`response` DSL blocks are
///   collected as group-level assignments. A full fix requires either
///   recognizing rswag DSL methods or implementing per-assignment reference
///   tracking like VariableForce.
/// - jruby `platform_is` conditional reassignment: variables conditionally
///   reassigned inside `platform_is :windows do ... end` blocks need
///   VariableForce-style branching analysis.
/// - 286 FNs from VariableForce scope tracking gaps.
///
/// ## Investigation (FP=41, FN=1059, 2026-03-20)
///
/// **FN fix: iterator block assignments (major FN source)**
/// `var_value_reaches_example_scope_in_stmts` walked top-level statements
/// linearly and, upon finding the statement containing the assignment offset,
/// `continue`d to the next sibling. When the assignment was inside a non-RSpec
/// block (e.g., `.each do |v| val = v; context ... do it ... end end`), both
/// the assignment and the example scopes were inside the same statement — so
/// skipping to the next sibling missed all references. Fix: fall through to
/// `stmt_example_scope_var_interaction` on the containing statement instead
/// of `continue`-ing past it. This addresses the dominant FN pattern (puppet,
/// datadog, sensu repos using `.each` for parameterized specs).
///
/// **Remaining gaps:**
/// - FP=~41: rswag DSL, platform_is conditional reassignment, file-level
///   variables reassigned conditionally in hooks. All require VariableForce-
///   level flow analysis.
/// - FN: VariableForce's comprehensive scope tracking across all Ruby scope
///   boundaries. Our AST-walking heuristics handle common patterns but can't
///   replicate VariableForce's full dataflow analysis. A complete fix would
///   require implementing VariableForce in Rust.
///
/// ## Investigation (FP=3, FN=77, 2026-03-21)
///
/// FP=3: All from jruby which lacks rubocop-rspec in Gemfile (same infra
/// issue as ScatteredLet/que-rb). RuboCop skips RSpec cops when the plugin
/// isn't installed; nitrocop runs them because they're compiled in.
/// Not a cop logic bug — nitrocop is correct for actual RSpec files.
///
/// FN fixes (3 root causes):
/// 1. **ConstantPathNode in `node_references_var`**: `result::Success` was
///    not handled. When a variable is used as the parent of a constant path
///    (e.g., `describe result::Success`), the `ConstantPathNode` fell through
///    to `false`. Fixed by recursing into `cp.parent()`.
/// 2. **If-condition assignments**: `if error = spec['error']` embeds a
///    `LocalVariableWriteNode` in the `IfNode.predicate()`, which
///    `collect_assignments_in_scope` and `collect_file_level_assignments`
///    did not check. Fixed by recursing into predicate for both functions.
/// 3. **`RSpec.describe` inside non-RSpec blocks**: `stmt_example_scope_var_interaction`
///    and `check_var_used_in_example_scopes` only matched `describe` with no
///    receiver (`no_recv`), missing `RSpec.describe` (receiver is `RSpec`).
///    Fixed by adding `is_rspec_recv` check alongside `no_recv`.
/// 4. **`LocalVariableWriteNode` in interaction/scope checks**: `spec = RSpec.describe ...`
///    wraps the example group call in an assignment node, which both
///    `stmt_example_scope_var_interaction` and `check_var_used_in_example_scopes`
///    did not recurse into. Fixed by handling `as_local_variable_write_node()`.
/// 5. **Example group arguments**: `describe result::Success do` uses a variable
///    as an argument to the example group call. Both `stmt_example_scope_var_interaction`
///    and `check_var_used_in_example_scopes` only recursed into the block body,
///    not the call arguments. Fixed by checking `call.arguments()`.
///
/// Remaining FN gap (~20): `def self.method` bodies containing `.each` with
/// `context`/`let` blocks (DataDog pattern). These create a separate Ruby
/// scope that our AST-walking approach doesn't enter. A full fix requires
/// VariableForce-level scope tracking.
