# Agent Dispatch for Corpus Conformance

Automated system for fixing corpus conformance gaps by dispatching remote agents (via Kilo Cloud Agent + MiniMax BYOK) to fix one cop at a time. Each agent gets a self-contained task prompt, works on a prepared branch, and pushes changes validated by CI.

## Architecture

```
You (any machine with gh CLI)
  │
  │  gh workflow run agent-cop-fix.yml -f cop="Style/NegatedWhile"
  ▼
GitHub Actions (agent-cop-fix.yml)
  │  1. Checkout repo with vendor submodules
  │  2. generate-cop-task.py → self-contained task prompt
  │  3. Create + push branch: fix/style-negated_while
  │  4. kilo_dispatch.py → POST task to Kilo webhook
  ▼
Kilo Cloud Agent (MiniMax M2.7-highspeed via BYOK)
  │  1. Clones repo, runs startup commands (install Rust, cargo build,
  │     remove CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md so agent reads only .kilocode/rules/)
  │  2. Reads task prompt + .kilocode/rules/cop-fix.md
  │  3. TDD: add test → verify fails → fix cop → verify passes
  │  4. Auto-commits and pushes to branch after each message
  ▼
GitHub CI (on push to the branch)
  │  checks.yml: clippy, full test suite, corpus smoke test
  │  agent-cop-check.yml: per-cop count check vs extended corpus baseline
  ▼
You review + merge (or retry with stronger model)
```

## One-Time Setup

### Step 1: MiniMax Token Plan

1. Go to [platform.minimax.io](https://platform.minimax.io/subscribe/token-plan)
2. Subscribe to **Plus-Highspeed** ($40/mo) — 4,500 requests per 5-hour window on M2.7-highspeed
3. Note your MiniMax API key

This is enough for all 319 Tier 1 cops. Upgrade to Max-Highspeed ($80/mo, 15K req/5hr) if you hit rate limits.

### Step 2: Kilo Cloud Agent

1. Sign up at [kilo.ai](https://kilo.ai)
2. Connect your GitHub repo under **Integrations**
3. Create an **environment profile** named `minimax-highspeed`:
   - BYOK provider: MiniMax
   - API key: your MiniMax API key
   - Model: MiniMax M2.7-highspeed
   - Startup commands:
     ```bash
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
     source $HOME/.cargo/env
     cargo build
     rm -f CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md
     rm -rf .agents/ .claude/ .devcontainer/ .github/ bench/ docs/ gem/ scripts/
     ```
4. Create a **webhook trigger** linked to the `minimax-highspeed` profile:
   - Prompt template: `{{bodyJson}}` (the dispatch sends JSON with a `message` field containing the full task)
   - Inbound auth: set a shared secret (this becomes `KILO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in GitHub secrets)
5. Note the webhook URL

The startup commands install Rust, build the project, and remove large instruction files that would confuse the agent. The agent gets its instructions from `.kilocode/rules/cop-fix.md` (committed to the repo) and the task prompt (sent via webhook). These deletions are ephemeral — they only happen in the container and are never committed.

**Optional: additional profiles for harder cops.** Create more environment profiles (`claude-sonnet`, `claude-opus`) with Anthropic API keys instead of MiniMax. Create a webhook trigger for each. You only need `minimax-highspeed` to start.

### Step 3: GitHub Repository Secrets

Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add:

| Secret | Value | Required? |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `KILO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Shared secret you set on the Kilo webhook trigger (any random string) | Yes |
| `KILO_WEBHOOK_MINIMAX` | Webhook URL for minimax-highspeed profile | Yes |
| `KILO_WEBHOOK_CLAUDE_SONNET` | Webhook URL for claude-sonnet profile | For Tier 2 cops |
| `KILO_WEBHOOK_CLAUDE_OPUS` | Webhook URL for claude-opus profile | For Tier 3 cops |

### Step 4: Branch Protection

Prevent agents from pushing directly to `main`.

**Recommended: GitHub Ruleset (restricts agents, not you)**

Go to **Settings > Rules > Rulesets > New ruleset**:

- Name: `agent-pr-required`
- Enforcement: Active
- Targets: `main` branch
- Bypass list: Add your GitHub username
- Rules:
  - [x] Require a pull request before merging
  - [x] Require status checks to pass (add `build-and-test`, `cop-check`)

### Step 5: Verify kilo_dispatch.py

The dispatch script sends a JSON POST to the Kilo webhook. The current payload format is a best-guess:

```json
{"message": "<task prompt>", "metadata": {"cop": "Style/NegatedWhile", "branch": "fix/style-negated_while"}}
```

You may need to adjust `scripts/agent/kilo_dispatch.py` (~125 lines) once you test with Kilo's actual webhook API. The Kilo webhook docs say `{{body}}` and `{{bodyJson}}` template variables are available in the trigger's prompt template.

## Operator Workflow

This is what YOU do locally (or ask Claude to do). The agents handle the coding.

### Phase 1: Triage (5 min)

See what needs fixing and how hard it is:

```bash
# Overall picture
python3 scripts/agent/tier_cops.py --extended

# Output:
#   Tier 1 (1-50 FP+FN): 319 cops, ~2,854 total FP+FN
#   Tier 2 (51-1000 FP+FN): 88 cops, ~26,877 total FP+FN
#   Tier 3 (1001+ FP+FN): 61 cops, ~441,907 total FP+FN

# Browse Tier 1 cops (sorted by difficulty)
python3 scripts/agent/tier_cops.py --extended --tier 1
```

**No per-cop investigation needed for Tier 1.** These are 1-50 FP+FN cops — the task packet already includes corpus examples with source context. Let the agent figure it out.

For **Tier 2+**, you may want to investigate first:

```bash
# Investigate a specific cop before dispatching
python3 scripts/investigate-cop.py Style/GuardClause --extended --context

# See which repos are affected
python3 scripts/investigate-cop.py Style/GuardClause --extended --repos-only
```

### Phase 2: Pilot (10 cops, ~1 hour)

Test the pipeline with the 10 easiest cops before scaling:

```bash
# Inspect a task packet first to see what the agent gets
python3 scripts/agent/generate-cop-task.py Style/VariableInterpolation --extended

# Dispatch 10 cops one at a time
for cop in \
  "Layout/ConditionPosition" \
  "Layout/SpaceInsideRangeLiteral" \
  "Layout/SpaceBeforeBrackets" \
  "Lint/DuplicateRegexpCharacterClassElement" \
  "Lint/ElseLayout" \
  "Lint/RescueException" \
  "Performance/ChainArrayAllocation" \
  "Style/NegatedWhile" \
  "Style/KeywordParametersOrder" \
  "Style/VariableInterpolation"; do
  gh workflow run agent-cop-fix.yml -f cop="$cop"
  sleep 5
done
```

**Check the results** (wait ~15-30 min for agents to finish):

```bash
# List recent PRs from agents
gh pr list --label agent-fix  # if you label them
gh pr list --search "Fix in:title"

# Check if CI passed on each
gh pr checks <pr-number>
```

**What to verify:**
- Did the agent push changes to the branch?
- Does CI pass (`checks.yml` + `agent-cop-check.yml`)?
- Did it follow TDD (test added before fix)?
- Did it stay within its cop's files?
- Did it add a `///` doc comment?

If ≥7/10 are usable → proceed to Phase 3. If <5/10 → tweak `.kilocode/rules/cop-fix.md` or the task template and re-pilot.

### Phase 3: Batch Dispatch (Tier 1)

```bash
# Dispatch all Tier 1 cops
python3 scripts/agent/tier_cops.py --extended --tier 1 --names | while read cop; do
  gh workflow run agent-cop-fix.yml -f cop="$cop"
  sleep 5  # avoid GHA rate limiting
done
```

This dispatches ~319 cops. At Kilo's 20 in-flight cap per webhook, they'll queue and execute over several hours.

**Monitor progress:**

```bash
# How many PRs are open?
gh pr list --state open | wc -l

# How many passed CI?
gh pr list --state open --search "status:success" | wc -l
```

**Merge the good ones:**

```bash
# Review and merge a PR
gh pr view <number>
gh pr merge <number> --squash
```

### Phase 4: Retry Failures

After the first pass, some cops will have failed PRs (CI failure, wrong fix, etc.):

```bash
# Retry with a stronger model — auto-includes prior attempt context
gh workflow run agent-cop-retry.yml -f cop="Style/VariableInterpolation"

# Retry with extra guidance
gh workflow run agent-cop-retry.yml \
  -f cop="Style/VariableInterpolation" \
  -f model="claude-sonnet" \
  -f extra_context="The FN is a global variable interpolation (#\$0) not an instance variable"
```

The retry workflow automatically:
- Finds all prior failed PRs for that cop
- Extracts their diffs and CI failure logs
- Closes stale open PRs
- Sends everything to the agent so it doesn't repeat mistakes
- Defaults to `claude-sonnet` (stronger than MiniMax)

### Phase 5: Validate

After merging a batch (~20-50 PRs), run the full corpus oracle:

```bash
gh workflow run corpus-oracle.yml -f corpus_size=extended
```

This takes ~90 min and validates against all 5,593 repos with exact location matching.

### Phase 6: Tier 2 (Optional — harder cops)

For Tier 2 cops (51-1000 FP+FN), investigate before dispatching:

```bash
# Investigate the cop
python3 scripts/investigate-cop.py Style/GuardClause --extended --context

# If the pattern is clear, dispatch with claude-sonnet
gh workflow run agent-cop-fix.yml -f cop="Style/GuardClause" -f model="claude-sonnet"

# If it's really hard, use opus
gh workflow run agent-cop-fix.yml -f cop="Layout/IndentationWidth" -f model="claude-opus"
```

For Tier 3 cops (1001+ FP+FN), use Claude Code's `/fix-department` workflow locally — these have fundamental implementation gaps that need deep investigation.

## How It Works

### Task Packet

`generate-cop-task.py` produces a single markdown document per cop containing:

- **Focused instructions**: TDD workflow, fixture format, validation commands
- **The cop's Rust source** (`src/cop/<dept>/<name>.rs`)
- **RuboCop's Ruby implementation** (ground truth from `vendor/`)
- **RuboCop spec excerpts** (`expect_offense` / `expect_no_offenses` blocks)
- **Current test fixtures** (`offense.rb`, `no_offense.rb`)
- **Corpus FP/FN examples** with source context
- **Prism pitfall notes** (only if relevant to this cop)

### Agent Configuration

The agent's behavior is controlled by two things:

1. **`.kilocode/rules/cop-fix.md`** (committed to repo) — focused rules for cop-fix tasks: what to modify, how to test, fixture format, Prism notes
2. **Startup commands** (in Kilo environment profile) — remove CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and .claude/skills/ so the agent doesn't read irrelevant project context

### CI Validation

**`checks.yml`** (existing, runs on all PRs):
- `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`, full `cargo test`, corpus smoke test

**`agent-cop-check.yml`** (new, runs when cop files change):
- Auto-detects which cop(s) changed via git diff
- Downloads `corpus-results.json` from the latest CI corpus oracle run
- Runs `check-cop.py --extended --verbose` — count check against cached baseline
- Advisory only (cached data may be stale)

Neither workflow runs against the full 5,593-repo corpus. Use `corpus-oracle.yml` for definitive validation after merging batches.

### Cop Tiers

| Tier | FP+FN | Count | Model | Est. Cost |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | 1-50 | ~319 | MiniMax M2.7-highspeed | $40/mo plan |
| 2 | 51-1000 | ~88 | Claude Sonnet (BYOK) | ~$0.60/cop |
| 3 | 1001+ | ~61 | Claude Opus (BYOK) | ~$2-5/cop |

All tiers use the same Kilo Cloud Agent — just different BYOK model profiles.

## Scripts

| Script | Where it runs | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `scripts/agent/generate-cop-task.py` | GitHub Actions | Produces self-contained task prompt |
| `scripts/agent/tier_cops.py` | Your laptop | Classifies cops by difficulty |
| `scripts/agent/detect_changed_cops.py` | GitHub Actions (CI) | Maps git diff to cop names |
| `scripts/agent/kilo_dispatch.py` | GitHub Actions | Sends task to Kilo webhook |
| `scripts/agent/collect_prior_attempts.py` | GitHub Actions (retry) | Gathers diffs + logs from prior failed PRs |

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `agent-cop-fix.yml` | `workflow_dispatch` | Generate task + create branch + dispatch to Kilo |
| `agent-cop-retry.yml` | `workflow_dispatch` | Retry with prior attempt context, close stale PRs |
| `agent-cop-check.yml` | PR (cop file changes) | Validate changed cops against corpus baseline |

## Security

- `workflow_dispatch` requires **write access** — public users can see the YAML but cannot trigger it
- Secrets are never exposed to forks or external PRs
- Branch protection / rulesets prevent pushing directly to `main`

## Fallback: Hetzner + MiniMax

If Kilo doesn't work out (15-min limit too tight, quality too low, etc.), the same task packets work with a self-hosted Hetzner box running Claude Code in headless mode with MiniMax via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`.
