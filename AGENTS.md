# nitrocop

Fast Ruby linter in Rust targeting RuboCop compatibility. Uses Prism for parsing and rayon for parallelism.

## Mental Model

- A **cop** is one RuboCop-compatible rule implemented in Rust under `src/cop/`.
- The **corpus** is the real-world repo set used to compare nitrocop against RuboCop. `standard` is the normal corpus; `extended` is the larger, slower one.
- The **corpus oracle** is the CI workflow that produces baseline `corpus-results.json` artifacts consumed by the Python investigation and regression tools.
- `bench/` contains benchmark and corpus tooling. In practice, `bench/corpus/` is where the Ruby bundle and corpus helpers live, while `bench_nitrocop` is the full benchmark/conformance driver.
- Most cop work follows this loop: add or update fixtures, make the cop pass targeted tests, then run per-cop corpus checks to confirm no regression.

## Read First

- If `GITHUB_ACTIONS` is set, also read [`docs/agent-ci.md`](docs/agent-ci.md) before making changes.
- For deeper Prism node-shape notes, see [`docs/node_pattern_analysis.md`](docs/node_pattern_analysis.md).
- For gem packaging and release details, see [`docs/rubygem.md`](docs/rubygem.md).
- Read [`docs/corpus-workflow.md`](docs/corpus-workflow.md) only when the task is to run or debug the operator workflows around corpus results, issue backlog management, or regression investigation, not when the task is simply to fix a cop.
- Do not read `docs/corpus-workflow.md` by default for ordinary cop implementation work, `agent-cop-fix`, or routine `agent-pr-repair` runs.

## Setup

```bash
git submodule update --init    # fetch vendor/rubocop and plugin submodules
```

## Dual-Platform Development

This repo is developed on both macOS and Linux. The devcontainer sets `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target-linux`, so Linux builds go to `target-linux/` while macOS uses `target/`.

Python scripts under `scripts/` resolve the binary path from `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` automatically.

## Commands

```bash
cargo check                 # fast compile check
cargo build                 # full build (includes Prism C FFI)
cargo test                  # run all tests
cargo run -- .              # lint current directory
cargo run -- -a .           # lint + autocorrect (safe cops only)
cargo run -- -A .           # lint + autocorrect (all cops, including unsafe)
cargo run -- --format json . # emit JSON diagnostics
cargo run -- --debug .      # print phase-level timing breakdown
```

## Before Committing

Run these checks before committing when you touched Rust code (`src/**/*.rs`, `bench/**/*.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`):

```bash
cargo fmt -- src/path/to/changed_file.rs    # format only the files you changed
cargo clippy --release -- -D warnings       # incremental when only a few files changed
cargo test --release
```

If the change is non-Rust only, these Rust checks are optional and should not be run by default.

Important:

- Run `cargo fmt` on the specific Rust files you changed, not `cargo fmt` with no args.
- Run `cargo clippy` normally; it benefits from incremental compilation.
- Do not use `git diff` to discover changed files on shared branches. Check the files you intentionally edited.

For iterative cop development, prefer filtered debug tests:

```bash
cargo test --lib -- cop::style::while_until_modifier
cargo test --lib -- cop::style::
```

When you touch Python under `scripts/`, `tests/python/`, or `bench/corpus/`, run Ruff on the smallest relevant scope:

```bash
python3 -m ruff check --fix path/to/changed.py
python3 -m ruff check path/to/changed.py
```

## Repo Layout

- `src/cop/` — cop implementations by department
- `tests/fixtures/cops/` — per-cop offense and no-offense fixtures
- `scripts/` — public CLI tools
- `scripts/workflows/` — workflow-only internals
- `scripts/shared/` — shared Python helpers
- `bench/` — corpus and benchmark tooling

## Key Constraints

- `ruby_prism::ParseResult` is `!Send + !Sync`, so parsing must happen inside each rayon worker thread.
- The `Cop` trait is `Send + Sync`; cops that need mutable visitor state should create a temporary visitor struct internally.
- Edition 2024 / Rust 1.85+.
- Cops disabled by default in vendor config must override `default_enabled() -> false`, or they will produce false positives when vendored config loading fails.
- Plugin cops depend on the target project's installed gem version, not just the vendored submodule version in this repo.

## Fixture Rules

- Standard cop fixtures use `tests/fixtures/cops/<dept>/<cop_name>/offense.rb` and `no_offense.rb`.
- Cops that fire once per file or do not fit `^` annotations can use an `offense/` scenario directory plus `no_offense.rb`.
- False positives belong in `no_offense.rb`; missed detections belong in `offense.rb`.
- `# nitrocop-expect:` and `# nitrocop-filename:` are valid fixture directives when standard `^` annotations are not enough.
- Every real behavior fix must add or update fixtures.

## Corpus Quick Reference

Start with cached corpus tools before rerunning expensive checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/investigate-cop.py Department/CopName
python3 scripts/investigate-cop.py Department/CopName --context
python3 scripts/investigate-repo.py rails
python3 scripts/reduce-mismatch.py Department/CopName repo_id path/to/file.rb:line
```

Use `check-cop.py` for aggregate regression checks after a fix:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-cop.py Department/CopName
python3 scripts/check-cop.py Department/CopName --verbose --rerun --quick
python3 scripts/verify-cop-locations.py Department/CopName
```

Important:

- `investigate-cop.py` and `investigate-repo.py` auto-download the latest corpus artifacts. Do not manually download them first.
- `check-cop.py` is count-only; use `verify-cop-locations.py` when you need location-level confirmation.
- “file-drop noise” is not an excuse for FN gaps. Investigate the actual missed examples.
- `check-cop.py --rerun` depends on the bundle under `bench/corpus/vendor/bundle/`. If needed:

```bash
cd bench/corpus
BUNDLE_PATH=vendor/bundle bundle install
```

- Do not run `cargo run --release --bin bench_nitrocop -- conform` by default during cop-fix loops. Use per-cop corpus gates unless the task explicitly asks for full conformance regeneration.

## Core Rules

- Use TDD for cop fixes.
- Every real behavior fix must add or update tests.
- Do not remove or move existing fixture cases unless they are factually wrong.
- Do not use `git stash`.
- Do not use broad restore commands like `git restore .` or `git checkout -- .`.
- Commit early and often on shared branches.
- Ignore unrelated working-tree changes unless asked to handle them.
- Never copy code or identifiers from private repos into this repo.
- Document cop investigation findings as `///` doc comments on the cop struct.
- When editing a skill, check related skills that share conventions or workflows.

## Notes

- Top-level Python entrypoints in `scripts/` are public CLIs and use kebab-case names.
- Workflow internals belong in `scripts/workflows/`.
- Shared Python helpers belong in `scripts/shared/`.
- Keep vendor submodules pinned to release tags, not arbitrary commits.
