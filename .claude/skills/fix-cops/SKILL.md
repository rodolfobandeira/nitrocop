# Fix Cops — Post-Corpus-Oracle Batch Fix

This skill runs after a corpus oracle CI run. It triages the results, picks the
highest-impact cops to fix, and dispatches parallel teammates (each in an
isolated git worktree) to investigate and fix them.
It is corpus-only: synthetic-only cops will not appear here and should be handled
via `/fix-department`.

If you edit code yourself (without dispatching teammates), do that work in a dedicated
git worktree by default. Only skip this when the user explicitly asks to use the current tree.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Triage (you do this)

1. Download corpus results and run triage (automatically excludes cops fixed since the oracle run):
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/skills/triage/scripts/triage.py --limit 20 $ARGUMENTS
   ```

2. From the triage output, select **up to 4 cops** to fix in this batch. Prioritize:
   - **Highest total divergence** (FP+FN) — these move overall conformance the most
   - All departments are fair game, including Layout cops
   - Consider feasibility: prefer cops where the FP/FN pattern is identifiable and fixable over cops where the root cause is unclear

3. For each selected cop, run investigate-cop.py to understand the divergence pattern:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/investigate-cop.py Department/CopName --context --limit 10
   ```
   Use `--fp-only` or `--fn-only` to focus on one side if the cop has both.

4. **Run the delta reducer** on up to 3 FP examples per cop to get minimal reproductions:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/reduce-mismatch.py Department/CopName repo_id filepath:line
   ```
   The repo_id and filepath:line come directly from investigate-cop.py output. Pick examples
   from different repos when possible to catch distinct root causes. The reduced files
   (typically 5–20 lines) go to `/tmp/nitrocop-reduce/` — read them and include them in the
   teammate prompt.

5. Summarize your picks: cop name, FP count, minimal repro(s), and root cause hypothesis.

### Phase 2: Dispatch (you do this)

1. Create a team:
   ```
   TeamCreate(team_name="fix-cops", description="Batch cop fixes from corpus oracle")
   ```

2. Create tasks for each cop fix.

3. Spawn one teammate per cop using the Agent tool. **Critical settings:**
   - `isolation: "worktree"` — each teammate gets its own git worktree (NO git stash/pop!)
   - `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` — needs full edit/bash access
   - `team_name: "fix-cops"`
   - `mode: "bypassPermissions"` — teammates need to run cargo test etc.

   **Worktree caveat:** `isolation: "worktree"` may silently fail, leaving the teammate
   writing directly to the main tree. The teammate workflow below includes a self-check.
   During Phase 4, also verify with `git status --short` that no leaked changes landed on main.

4. Each teammate prompt MUST include:
   - The exact cop name (e.g., `Style/PercentQLiterals`)
   - The FP count and root cause hypothesis from your investigation
   - **The minimal repro(s) from the delta reducer** — paste the reduced Ruby source directly
   - A reminder that parallel-agent activity often leaves unrelated local modifications; those files are off-limits
   - The teammate workflow (Phase 3 below) — paste the full instructions

### Phase 3: Teammate Workflow (paste this into each teammate's prompt)

```
You are fixing false positives in a single nitrocop cop. Follow the CLAUDE.md rules strictly.

**NEVER use git stash or git stash pop.** You should be in an isolated git worktree — just commit directly.
Parallel-agent activity is common. If you see unrelated modified files, do not edit/revert them.

## Step 0: Verify your working directory

Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and check that it contains `.claude/worktrees/` in the path.
If you are in the main repo (no worktree), note this in your report — your commits will land
directly on main.

## Steps

1. **Read the cop source** at `src/cop/<dept>/<cop_name>.rs`
   Read the vendor RuboCop spec at `vendor/rubocop*/spec/rubocop/cop/<dept>/<cop_name>_spec.rb`
   **Check for existing investigation comments** (marked with "Known false positives" or
   "reverted") — these document previously attempted fixes that regressed on corpus
   validation. Do NOT repeat the same approach. Either find a different root cause or
   extend the prior approach to avoid its documented failure mode.

2. **Understand the FP pattern** from the examples provided in your prompt.
   If needed, read the actual source files from `vendor/corpus/<repo_id>/<path>` to see more context.
   **DO NOT run nitrocop or rubocop directly** — not on corpus repos, not on ad-hoc
   files in `/tmp/`, not anywhere outside the test fixtures. Running `nitrocop` on
   arbitrary paths fails ("No lockfile found") and wastes tokens. The ONLY ways to
   verify cop behavior are:
   - **Unit tests**: add patterns to `offense.rb` / `no_offense.rb` fixtures and run
     `cargo test --lib -- <cop_name_snake>` — this is fast, reliable, and self-documenting.
   - **Corpus validation**: `check-cop.py --rerun` for cops you modified; `check-cop.py
     --verbose` for untouched cops when the latest corpus oracle run is current.
   Never create test Ruby files outside the fixture directories.

3. **Add test cases (TDD)**:
   - Add the FP pattern to `tests/fixtures/cops/<dept>/<cop_name>/no_offense.rb`
   - Run `cargo test --lib -- <cop_name_snake>` to verify the test FAILS (proving the FP exists)
   - Use debug mode (no `--release`) for fast TDD iteration (~8s first run, <1s incremental)

4. **Fix the cop implementation** in `src/cop/<dept>/<cop_name>.rs`
   - Iterate with `cargo test --lib -- <cop_name_snake>` (debug mode) until tests pass

5. **Verify (pre-commit, release mode)**:
   - `cargo test --release -p nitrocop --lib -- <cop_name_snake>` — all tests pass
   - `cargo fmt`
   - `cargo clippy --release -- -D warnings`

6. **Commit your fix**:
   ```bash
   git add src/cop/<dept>/<cop_name>.rs tests/fixtures/cops/<dept>/<cop_name>/no_offense.rb
   # Add any other changed fixture files
   git commit -m "Fix <Department/CopName> false positives

   <one-line description of what was wrong>

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```
   Stage only files for this cop fix. Do not include unrelated modified files.

7. **Report back** via SendMessage with:
   - What the FP root cause was
   - What you changed
   - Whether tests pass
   - The commit SHA
```

### Phase 4: Collect Results (you do this)

1. Wait for all teammates to report back.

2. For each completed fix:
   - Note the worktree branch name from the Task result
   - Cherry-pick or merge the commit into your working branch

3. Run full verification:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt
   cargo clippy --release -- -D warnings
   cargo test --release
   ```

4. Verify each fixed cop against the corpus:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/check-cop.py Department/CopName --verbose --rerun
   ```
   Run these in parallel (background). **Corpus validation is the acceptance gate** —
   unit tests passing is necessary but NOT sufficient. Use `--rerun` only for cops
   changed in this batch; for untouched cops, use artifact mode (`--verbose`).

5. **Handle regressions**: if a fix increases FP count (even if unit tests pass), revert
   the code change but **add a detailed investigation comment** to the cop source file
   documenting:
   - What approach was tried (with the reverted commit SHA)
   - Exact code path changed (function/condition)
   - Acceptance-gate numbers before and after (`expected`, `actual`, `excess`, `missing`)
   - Why it regressed (root cause of the new FPs)
   - What a correct fix would need to do differently
   This prevents future attempts from repeating the same failed approach. Use the format:
   ```rust
   /// ## Known false positives (N FP in corpus as of YYYY-MM-DD)
   ///
   /// An attempt was made to ... (commit XXXXXXXX, reverted). The approach: ...
   /// Code path changed: <file::function and condition changed>.
   /// Acceptance gate before: expected=?, actual=?, excess=?, missing=?
   /// Acceptance gate after: expected=?, actual=?, excess=?, missing=?
   /// This fixed the target FPs but introduced N NEW false positives (X→Y FP).
   /// Root cause of regression: ...
   /// A correct fix needs to: ...
   ```

6. **Document ALL investigation outcomes** as `///` comments on the cop's struct in its
   source file — not just regressions and reverts, but also cops investigated and found
   to need no fix (e.g., FPs caused by file-drop noise, config artifacts, etc.). This
   prevents future investigators from repeating the same analysis. Use:
   ```rust
   /// ## Corpus investigation (YYYY-MM-DD)
   ///
   /// Corpus oracle run #N reported FP=X, FN=Y. Investigation found ...
   /// <conclusion and whether a fix is needed>
   ```

7. Report to the user:
   - Which cops were fixed (with FP counts)
   - Which cops regressed and were reverted (with investigation comments added)
   - Summary of changes ready for commit/PR

### Phase 5: Integrate Back to Main (Default)

Do not leave retained progress only in a worktree/collector branch.

1. Ensure all retained progress is committed:
   - Accepted cop fixes: one commit per cop (preferred).
   - Useful investigation artifacts retained in repo (for example, reverted-attempt notes): separate commit.

2. Integrate those commit(s) into `main` immediately (unless the user explicitly says not to).
   If teammates committed in worktrees, cherry-pick from the worktree branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git cherry-pick <sha1> [<sha2> ...]
   ```
   If teammates committed directly on main (worktree isolation failed), their commits
   are already on main — just verify with `git log`.

3. Verify integration on `main`:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -n 10
   git status --short --branch
   ```

4. Report exactly what was integrated (commit SHA(s) and short subjects).

5. If there is truly no repo-retained progress, explicitly report that no commit was made.

## Arguments

Pass arguments through to the triage script:
- `/fix-cops` — default: top cops by total divergence (FP+FN)
- `/fix-cops --department Style` — only Style cops
- `/fix-cops --fp-only` — only fix FP-only cops (legacy behavior)
- `/fix-cops --limit 10` — consider more candidates
- `/fix-cops --input /path/to/corpus-results.json` — use local file
